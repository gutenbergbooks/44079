<h1 id='t37'>CHAPTER I</h1>

<p>It is not a fact that clothespins are threshed out
like beans or wheat. They are not a product
of nature, but of art and machinery. A clear understanding
of this is necessary before the story can
begin to march; for if clothespins had grown in
fields inclosed by rail fences, and were gathered by
the aid of a self-binder, there never would have been
an individual known from coast to coast as Clothespin
Jimmy. This individual would not have had
a son named James, nor would Clothespin Jimmy
have started to build a new clothespin-mill in Diversity,
Michigan. So it is manifest that the fact
stated in the first paragraph hereof lies at the very
tap-root of the whole matter.</p>

<p>If you studied sufficiently over the hieroglyphics
appended by Clothespin Jimmy at the end of a
check you discovered them to indicate the signature
“James Ashe.” But it required more than a passing
glance. Nobody ever quarreled with the signature,
because it suited the old man and was honored by
the bank.</p>

<p>The owner of the illegible signature was sixty-five
years old, was hale, hearty, and ripe for adventure.
Also he figured that fifty years of hard labor about
completed his sentence and that he was entitled
to play about.</p>

<p>Therefore he called home his son James, who had
shown an early and marked distaste for the clothespin
business, and took him into the library, where
there lived in ease and idleness some ninety feet of
assorted red, blue and black books. He opened the
conversation:</p>

<p>“Son, what name do folks call you by when they
speak to you?”</p>

<p>“Why—Jim, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Just Jim? Nothing describin’ it?”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least notion, father. Why should
they call me anything else?”</p>

<p>“No reason in the world. That’s what I’m gettin’
at in my feeble way. What do folks call me?”</p>

<p>“Clothespin Jimmy,” replied his son, promptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and when I die that’s what’s goin’ onto the
headstone. It means somethin’. There hain’t no
need for a verse of poetry and clasped hands.
‘Clothespin Jimmy’ tells the whole story. I don’t
mind sayin’ I’m proud of it. Just like I was proud
of the first dollar I ever handled—because I earned
it. Folks call me Clothespin Jimmy because I’ve
done things with clothespins—things that amount
to somethin’. Men don’t git names like that by
settin’ in one spot till their pants wear thin. Now,
take you—they call you Jim, and there the matter
ends. That’s where you end. You’re just Jim, like
seven hundred thousand other Jims. You don’t
stick up above the herd. Hain’t it about time folks
was findin’ reason to hitch a descriptive name onto
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m twenty-eight. I’ve got a good job. I’m
supporting myself and not taking a cent from you—”</p>

<p>“I’m not findin’ fault with what you’ve done, son.
You ain’t a gilded butterfly—that ain’t what I mean.
You’re respectable and self-supportin’, but so’s
twenty million other boys in this country. You’re
just a good average human critter. But that’s not
even comin’ close to the subject, which is that ma
and me would like to go to Californy.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, dad. When do you start?”</p>

<p>“As things is we don’t start at all.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Largely because you’re satisfied to have folks
call you Jim without any description to it.” The old
gentleman took a package of folded papers from a
drawer and slid the rubber band off them.</p>

<p>“Here’s somethin’,” he said. “Bonds. Fifty of
’em for a thousand dollars apiece. Net five per cent.
I’ve milked the business to get ’em. ’Twasn’t right
by the business, but I done it just the same. Now,
then, you never liked the clothespin business. Don’t
know why. So I’ve fixed it so you could pick and
choose between two things. I’ll come to that in a
minute. But first, about Californy. I started supportin’
myself when I was fifteen, and I’ve been
hard at it ever since—fifty years. The time’s come
for me to git out with your ma and have a good time
if we’re ever a-goin’ to. Short time for frolickin’
left at best. But it rests with you. I figger I’ve
earned the right to loaf, but I can’t loaf without
leavin’ somebody to labor. There hain’t nobody but
you.” He stopped and looked at Jim and slapped
the package of bonds on the desk-top three or four
times.</p>

<p>“There ought to be somethin’ to you more ’n just
Jim. I’ve waited to see it crop out. Now I’m goin’
to dig for it. Here’s these bonds. Yonder in Diversity
is the new mill almost ready to start turnin’
over. It’ll be worth a quarter of a million to somebody.
I can make it so in a year. What I got you
in here for was to offer you your choice. You can
take the mill and the business and have it till God
does you part—and buckle in like I’ve done; or
you can take this fifty thousand in bonds and go
play. If you take the mill, your ma and me take the
bonds and go play. There’s the proposition. Take
which you like—and no hard feelin’s.”</p>

<p>“But, dad, suppose I don’t take either?”</p>

<p>The old man’s face changed; his eyes grew anxious;
the hand that held the bonds trembled ever so little.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t do that to me, son. Ever since
that night twenty-eight years ago when I heard a
miserable squawkin’ sound up-stairs and mistrusted
it was you, I’ve been workin’ and plannin’ and
hopin’—with you as the object of it all. I wanted
to fix things for you, son—and I’ve done it. You
don’t need to take the business if you don’t want to.
Your ma and me can keep on like we’ve been goin’,
and have consid’able fun, too. But if you was to
refuse both, then I’d feel as if I’d sort of wasted my
time—as if my workin’ and livin’ hadn’t been for no
good at all. You—you wouldn’t do that to your
dad, would you, son?”</p>

<p>Young Jim walked to the window and stood
looking out, and as he looked out he reviewed his
own plans and scheme of life, his hopes and private
aspirations. Presently he turned:</p>

<p>“No, dad, I won’t refuse both. I’ll take one or
the other.”</p>

<p>Clothespin Jimmy’s face showed his relief.</p>

<p>“Much ’bliged, son,” he said, as though he were
accepting a notable favor instead of giving away
what folks not addicted to polo or divorces or Fifth
Avenue or ocean-going yachts would consider a
fortune.</p>

<p>Jim returned to his window; his father sat thumbing
the bonds and waiting. Presently the old man
spoke suddenly:</p>

<p>“I don’t want you tradin’ unsight-unseen. You’re
entitled to know what you’re up against. In case
you take the mill—I milked it for these bonds. I
told you that. The business will need this money
and need it bad. I’ve built big. The day the mill
starts runnin’ you h’ist a debt of seventy thousand
dollars onto your shoulder. You’ll be pinched for
money, and you’ll have a devil of a time. But I
could pull it through—and so can you if you’re any
good. You ain’t steppin’ into a snap—not by several
statute miles. Furthermore, if you take her you
take her for better or for worse. You git no help
from me. These bonds’ll be all I have, and I’ll need
’em. I won’t let loose of one of ’em to keep you out
of bankruptcy. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Got your mind made up?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather sleep on it, dad. Suppose we put it
off till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“If you’re the man to handle the job you can
decide now. Puttin’ off never helped matters. A
man that makes up his mind right off may be wrong
half the time, but he’s right a whole lot more than
the fellow who has to have a decision jerked out of
him with an ox-team. If you expect to get anywheres
in this world, learn to make up your mind
swift and follow up with swift action. We’ll finish
the deal now before quittin’-time.”</p>

<p>Jim turned and looked at his father. Somehow he
felt detached from himself, as if he were sitting at a
distance twiddling his thumbs and watching his own
wheels go round. He occupied the position of
spectator very briefly, however, but popped back
inside of himself and took possession again—with a
noticeable change. He felt different. He did not
feel like Jim Ashe as he had been acquainted with
Jim Ashe, but like another individual of markedly
different characteristics. This change manifested
itself in his reply:</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll decide now. Now!”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Clothespin Jimmy, his fingers tightening
ever so little.</p>

<p>“I take the mill,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Huh!” his father said.</p>

<p>That was all. He slipped the bonds into his side
pocket. From another pocket he drew an envelope
holding two long, many-times-folded strips of blue
paper. Jim recognized them as railroad tickets.</p>

<p>“You’d better go to Diversity on Friday. This is
Tuesday. Your ma and me leave for Californy on
Friday mornin’.”</p>

<p>Jim eyed his father suspiciously. “Had the
tickets all the time?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You were going, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“No; not unless you took the mill.” The old
man chuckled.</p>

<p>Jim snorted. “Pretty sure how I’d decide, weren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, seein’ as you’re my son—and your ma’s—I
wasn’t more ’n a mite worried. I figgered you was
sound timber, but there was always the chance that
sap rot had got at you. That envelope there was
the stock certificates, all indorsed over to you, inside
of it. Take ’em. You’re the proprietor of the Ashe
Clothespin Company now. I’m through with it.
Fifty years of work to earn a couple of years of play
for ma and me. When we’re gone write us often.
We’ll need to hear from you. But don’t you dast to
mention clothespins to me—either good or bad about
’em. I’m through. Through for good and all—and
it’s up to you.”</p>

<p>“Done.” said young James.</p>

<h1 id='t297'>CHAPTER II</h1>

<p>Young Jim Ashe rode from five o’clock in the
morning until two in the afternoon on a train
that carried him through a stretch of the State of
Michigan that not even a local poet had ventured to
call lovely. It was flat as an exhausted purse—indeed,
it was an exhausted purse, for its wealth in straight,
clean pine had long since poured from it, down its
rivers to mills where it had been minted into money.
With this money a second generation that did not
know a wanigan from a cook-shanty, cork pine from
Norway, nor the difference between the Doyle and
Scribner scales, was getting its names in the Sunday
papers and illustrated magazines as bold and hardy
owners of imported Chow dogs.</p>

<p>At the end of nine hours of travel through the sort
of scenery that would make the decorations of a
modern New York hotel a restful diversion, Jim
thought even a game of coon can with a traveling-man
which, as everybody knows, is the world’s most
futile method of passing time—would be a boon from
heaven. But there was neither drummer nor cards.
He was not the sort of person who could sit and
think, and when tired of that omit the thinking and
just sit. So he brooded. Long before he reached
Diversity he was terribly sorry for himself, which,
after all, is a species of mild pleasure enjoyed by
many. One conclusion he did reach—namely, that
Diversity must be the ultimate fag-end of desolation
trimmed with a fringe of black despair. When the
train stopped at Diversity’s depot he looked out
and felt that conclusion to be sound.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was heat. He could see it
rising in little wiggling waves from the blackened
sand; he could see it at work raising more blisters
on the paint of the station; he could see it struggling
in vain to reduce the weight of the baggage-master,
who was also telegraph-operator, station-agent, porter,
and information bureau. The next thing he saw
was a jumble of form and color that would have made
immortal a cubist who could have caught it and
labeled it “A Hole Raveled in Civilization’s Heel.”
But if the cubist had caught it he probably would
have called it “Gentleman in Union Suit Climbing
a Telegraph Pole,” and so passed Fame by on the
other side.</p>

<p>The station reminded him for all the world of a
flabby, disreputable redbird, squatting in the midst
of an hilariously ragamuffin brood which sat back
on its tails and derided her scurrilously. The
progeny consisted of coal-sheds, warehouses, nondescript
buildings where nothing was or apparently
ever had been done, a feed-mill and a water-tank.
All of them seemed to detest the perpendicular;
most of them leered through doors squeezed to the
shape of a clumsy diamond. Fire, thought Jim,
would bring a merciful release to the whole of them.</p>

<p>He alighted with all the pleasant anticipation of a
Christian martyr about to dip into a caldron of boiling
oil. No one was there to meet him, for no one
knew he was coming. He didn’t know where to go
and didn’t much care. All directions seemed equally
unpromising. However, before plunging into the
unknown he stopped in the shade of the building,
mopped his forehead, and took an observation.</p>

<p>Standing with the sun beating down upon her was
a young woman who looked at the departing train
with an expression like one Jim had seen on a girl’s
face as she stood in the bread-line. It spoke hunger.
In spite of his own discomfort Jim was interested, and
there can be no doubt he stared. He stared long
enough to observe that the young woman was dark,
with a heap of curling hair so black that even the
old, hard-working simile of the raven’s wing was
not of the slightest use to him. She was small, but
had one of those exquisite figures which just a little
startle one.</p>

<p>She did not impress Jim as at all pretty, but she did
impress him as a young person who might find difficulty
in letting somebody else have his own way.</p>

<p>She continued to stare hungrily after the train,
but presently she turned her eyes so they met Jim’s
stare. In a second she comprehended he was staring,
and she flashed resentment at him. She even bit
her lip with vexation. Then she turned abruptly—but
very gracefully, Jim noticed—and walked
across the tracks.</p>

<p>Jim flushed uncomfortably and looked about to
see if anybody had noticed his bit of bad manners and
its result. In a ramshackle buggy drawn up to
the platform sat an old man with square white
whiskers. Possibly “sat” is not the precise word
to use, for the old man rested mainly on the back
of his neck, allowing the rest of his body to clutter
up the space intended only for his legs and feet.
Jim picked up his bag and approached.</p>

<p>“Could you drive me to the hotel?” he asked.</p>

<p>The old man looked at Jim’s feet, at his ankles,
his knees, his belt-buckle, his cravat, finally into his
eyes. This took time, and the sun was hot on Jim’s
head.</p>

<p>“I could,” said the old man, finally. Then he
wiggled the lines. “Giddap, Tiffany,” he said,
wholly oblivious to Jim’s presence on earth. “Giddap
there. Stir yourself. G’long.”</p>

<p>Jim stood goggling after him, as nonplussed as if
the old fellow had suddenly developed the old-fashioned
dragon habit of spouting smoke and flames.
Behind Jim the fat station-agent laughed twice,
thus: “Heh! Heh!” which was all he could manage
on account of his weight and the heat. Jim’s
ears burned; he snatched up his grip and followed
in the wake of the buggy.</p>

<p>He halted before a sign which proclaimed that here
was the Diversity House. There did not seem to be
a great deal of bustle connected with this establishment;
as a matter of fact, there was no sign of
life at all unless you count an unshaven gentleman
in white woolen socks and a calico shirt, who lent
the support of his back to a post on the piazza and
snored feebly. Jim went in. The office was deserted.
He coughed. In another month Jim knew
how useless it was to seek to attract attention in that
hotel by coughing, indeed by anything short of exploding
dynamite on the floor. Next he tried kicking
the counter. At best it was only a hollow-sounding
sort of kick and got no results whatever.
Jim was growing impatient, so he inserted three or
four fingers in his mouth and whistled. It was a
lovely, ear-splitting, sleep-piercing whistle, and Jim
heard a movement on the porch.</p>

<p>The gentleman of the white socks peered through
the window, feeling of his ear as though it had been
sorely abused, and looked at Jim disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“Gosh all hemlock!” exclaimed the gentleman,
mildly.</p>

<p>“Are you the proprietor?” Jim demanded.</p>

<p>The gentleman stared some more. “Who? Me?
Ho! Don’t calc’late to be,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where is he? Dead?”</p>

<p>“If he is he hain’t let on to nobody. Seems
though he might be over t’ the printin’-office playin’
cribbage.”</p>

<p>“What do I do? Wait till he comes back before I
get a room?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t no objections, but mostly they go up and
pick out the room they like.”</p>

<p>Jim sighed impatiently and placed his bag on the
counter.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where the new mill is being
built?”</p>

<p>“Down the road a piece. Keep right a-goin’ and
you can’t miss the dum thing.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jim, and started out to inspect
the plant of which he had become proprietor.</p>

<p>Jim walked down the street, which did not run
ahead in a straight line, but meandered about aimlessly
as though trying for all it was worth to keep
under the shade of the fine big maples which bordered
it. Nobody could blame it. In fact, Jim thought it
showed extraordinary intelligence for an illiterate,
unpaved, country clodhopper of a road, for the shade
was the pleasantest, most friendly thing he had found
in Diversity.</p>

<p>In five minutes he rounded a bend and came upon
a flat which seemed like a huge platter on which
somebody was trying to fry a number of large and
small buildings. Half an eye could tell the buildings
were new, indeed unfinished. Heat-waves radiated
from their composition roofs, and as for their
corrugated-iron sides, Jim fancied their ugly red
was not due so much to paint as to the fact that
they were red-hot. Everywhere were men hurrying
about as if it were a reasonable day and they weren’t
in the least danger of sunstroke. Inside Jim could
hear the clang of hammers, the rasp of saws, the
multitude of sounds which denote the business of an
army of workmen.</p>

<p>It looked very big and raw and uninviting to him.
There was nothing homey about it at all. It didn’t
even look interesting, and Jim stood under a tree
and wished his father had chosen some other calling
than the manufacture of clothespins. He mopped
his head and wrinkled his nose, and grew very
gloomy at the thought that down there on that unspeakable
flat lay the work of his future years. His
dreams had been of something very different.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and walked rapidly
down on to his property, acting very much like a man
with a tender tooth on his way to the dentist’s.</p>

<p>As he walked along the side of the biggest building
he encountered a small Italian boy with a big pail of
water.</p>

<p>“Son,” he said, “where’s the office? Where’s the
boss?”</p>

<p>The big black eyes lighted; white teeth gleamed.</p>

<p>“You lika drink? Sure. I take you da office.”</p>

<p>Jim drank and followed the boy, whose bare feet
seemed miraculously to take no harm from the rubbish
he walked over.</p>

<p>“Me Pete.” he said, pointing to himself. “Me
carry da drink.” Then he pointed to a small frame
shack. “Dat da office,” he said.</p>

<p>Jim walked through the half-open door. Nobody
was there. On a drafting-table were drawings and
blue-prints; a roll-top desk was littered with papers
and letters. Jim sat down in a revolving-chair to
wait for the return of Mr. Wattrous, the engineer in
charge of construction. It was very hot and stuffy,
so he removed hat and coat and made himself at
home.</p>

<p>A man with a red face, a wilted collar, and a leather
document case entered presently.</p>

<p>“Afternoon,” he said, sinking into a chair and
mopping his face. “White’s my name. Fire-proof
paint. Jenkins was sick, so I came up, but I guess
you and me can fix things as well as him, eh?”</p>

<p>Before Jim could reply the individual continued:
“Now we can’t afford to pay you any fifteen per
cent. commission out of our own pockets. ’Tain’t
right we should. But here’s what we will do:
We’ll stand seven and a half and we’ll just add seven
and a half to the face of the invoices. See? You’ll
get your fifteen all right and we won’t get stung for
but half of it. Neat scheme and fair to all sides, eh?”</p>

<p>“Does sound neat,” Jim said, “but not economical.”</p>

<p>Mr. White laughed, as at a witticism.</p>

<p>“You poor engineers has got to live,” he said.</p>

<p>“True. Just out of curiosity, what price would
you be making us if there weren’t any commissions
to pay?”</p>

<p>“Umm, well—I guess we could figure twenty per
cent. off what it’s going to cost you.”</p>

<p>Jim said nothing, but scratched his head. He
wondered if Wattrous had added twenty per cent. to
costs all the way through. If so he had not been a
profitable investment.</p>

<p>“You’ll O. K. the invoices?”</p>

<p>“I guess likely I will—hereafter,” said Jim, and
turned to observe a heavy-set man in corduroys and
laced boots who entered with a roll of drawings in his
hands. This person looked inquiringly from Jim to
White.</p>

<p>“Make yourselves at home,” he said, ironically.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Jim, feeling now for the first
time a real interest in life. Indeed, he felt a sort of
humorous interest. The situation was not without
its ludicrous appeal. “Mr. Wattrous,” he said,
“allow me to present Mr. White. Mr. White sells
fire-proof paint.”</p>

<p>Wattrous scowled, seemed a bit perplexed. As for
White, his jaw dropped and he stared at Jim and
then at Wattrous with the expression of a man who
has been violently struck in the wind.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim, “Mr. White is generous. The
way he hands out commissions would astonish you.
Why, he’s going to give you fifteen per cent. just for
buying paint from him.”</p>

<p>Wattrous thrust out his jaw. “Who the devil
are you?” he said.</p>

<p>“Ashe,” said Jim; “James Ashe. I’m the fellow
that owns this mill.”</p>

<p>Mr. White made an unsuccessful attempt to rise,
but fell back under Wattrous’s furious glance; he
tried again, more successfully, and scuttled out of the
office at a speed that threatened further to wreck
his already lamentably wilted collar. Jim turned
sharply to Wattrous. He felt unlike himself; felt
the urge of a will he had not before experienced;
felt a sense of confidence; felt, indeed, a desire to do
something and to do it without delay.</p>

<p>“You, Wattrous—of course you’re fired.” His
voice hardened, became peremptory without his
volition. It seemed to do so of its own accord, and
Jim was conscious of mild surprise at it. “Get off
the job, and get quick,” he said, “before I decide to
pitch you off.”</p>

<p>Wattrous was of two minds. The first was to bulldoze
this young man and see if he couldn’t roar his
way out of his unpleasant predicament; the other
was to make matters worse by the application of personal
violence. He would have admired to thrash
Jim. Jim read his mind and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>“Git,” he said.</p>

<p>Wattrous hesitated an instant, then swung on his
heel and strode away muttering.</p>

<p>“I hope he meets up with White,” Jim said to
himself with a grin. “Nobody’ll get hurt who
doesn’t deserve it.” Then he leaned back in his
chair and gazed at the ceiling, reviewing the last few
moments. He had made a new acquaintance—the
acquaintance of Jim Ashe functioning in an emergency—and
it was a surprise to him.</p>

<p>“Is that the kind of man I am?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>Well, here he was. He was on the job, in the very
midst of it, a quite different beginning from what he
anticipated. He had expected to merge quietly into
the affairs of his new property, but he had not merged
into it unless one can say that a hammer thrown
through a glass window merges into it. He had
expected to enter his work with repugnance; now he
looked forward to his next official act with a tingle
of pleasant anticipation. After all, there might be
more to business than he suspected.</p>

<p>“What next?” he asked himself. He had, so to
speak, cut off the hand that directed, the head that
planned. They must be replaced, and Jim himself
had not the technical knowledge to fill the lack.
He went to the door and looked out; there, grinning
up at him, was little Pete, pail in hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Misser Boss!” said the boy.</p>

<p>“I take it you’ve been here right along,” said Jim,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“All da time. I hear you fire Misser Wattrous.
Whee!”</p>

<p>“I take it I have your approval.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” said Pete, clearly not at all understanding
what approval was. “I tell Italian mans. Dey
laugh. You real boss. Speakaqueek—bang! Italian
mans lika dat.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Now, Pete, who’s the next boss—who else
besides Mr. Wattrous?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Misser Nelson. He boss. Work wit’ da
hammer and saw, too.”</p>

<p>“Nelson, to be sure.” Nelson, Jim remembered,
was the head millwright in the old plant. “Where is
he, Pete?”</p>

<p>“I show. You come.”</p>

<p>Pete led the way. As they neared the main building
a young man not older than Jim emerged from the
door. His overalls were covered with grease and
sawdust, a rule protruded from a narrow pocket;
quite evidently he was of the carpentering clan.</p>

<p>“Dat Misser Nelson,” yelled Pete.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nelson!” called Jim.</p>

<p>The young man paused and turned a handsome,
sharply cut face toward Jim. It was a dependable
face, a likable face, a face, if the steel-blue eyes
were to be believed, which belonged to a man whose
action would follow swiftly his words, or even precede
them. He did not reply to Jim’s hail, but stood
waiting.</p>

<p>“Nelson,” said Jim, “my name is Ashe. My
father has gone to California and I am in charge
here.”</p>

<p>He paused briefly, and Nelson extended his hand
with a suddenly brightening smile.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just fired Wattrous. Somebody’s got to
take charge in his place. Can you take hold and
make this mill run?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good! You’re boss. What are we paying you?”</p>

<p>“Four dollars a day.”</p>

<p>“Wages. Your salary will be thirty-five dollars a
week. When can we begin to turn over?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wattrous figured four weeks.”</p>

<p>“We’ll start to manufacture in three. Put on
more men if necessary. Now let’s see where we’re
at.”</p>

<p>Nelson showed Jim through the mill, explaining
what must be done here, what was lacking there,
why this machine sat so, why another machine must
be driven from counter-shafting. He told him about
the conveyer system, about everything, for mills
and machinery were alike strange and mysterious to
Jim.</p>

<p>“Is the general plan good?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But if it were my mill I would—”</p>

<p>“It is your mill. Make it run and make it run
right. I’m going back to the office to have a look-see
at the books and files.”</p>

<p>As he sat in the revolving-chair he felt again a
wave of astonishment at himself. Was this Jim
Ashe—the same Jim Ashe who got off the train at
Diversity an hour ago? Most certainly it was, and
yet how little that Jim Ashe knew about himself.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m due for a personal inventory,” he said
to himself.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his investigations by the
whistle of the hoisting-engine. It was six o’clock.
He put on his coat and walked toward the road, and
as he went workmen nodded and smiled to him.</p>

<p>“The old man’s son,” he heard as he passed.</p>

<p>“Nelson says he’s hell on wheels,” was another
scrap of comment; but the one that pleased him
most, because it was unexpected, because it would
have pleased most his father, was spoken from the
opposite side of the fence out of his view:</p>

<p>“I heard him talkin’ to Nelson. He’ll make
things hum.”</p>

<p>“Who will?” asked another voice, apparently
joining the group.</p>

<p>“Why, Sudden Jim—Clothespin Jimmy’s boy.”</p>

<p>Jim walked back to the hotel with a new buoyancy
in his heart; his first half-day had been good. It
had introduced him to himself—and it had won him
a name.</p>

<h1 id='t795'>CHAPTER III</h1>

<p>Supper at the Diversity House surprised Jim
Ashe so much that it almost ruined his appetite.
He had expected the food to match the general efficiency
of the place, and had vaguely figured on the possibility
of dining on crackers and cheese. This teaches
us that, whereas man judges from the outward appearance,
he should wait till he sees what comes out of
the kitchen. It was the sort of meal you might expect
to eat in a prosperous farm-house—plentiful, well
cooked, and topped by apple pie that made Jim
wish he had started with dessert, continued with
dessert, and ended up with a final helping of it.
There are few things in this world more delightful
than a splendid meal that takes you by surprise.</p>

<p>He went out to sit on the porch, cool now with the
evening breeze off Lake Michigan. Sitting with his
back against a post, and looking as if he had not
shifted his position since Jim saw him early in the
afternoon, was the gentleman of the white socks and
calico shirt. He did not look up as Jim passed to
take a chair at the end of the piazza.</p>

<p>Presently there drew up before the hotel a ramshackle
buggy drawn by an animal that was undoubtedly
still a horse. It was a very Methuselah
among horses. The old man who rode in the buggy
appeared comparatively youthful beside it. Jim
smiled at the turnout, then frowned a trifle, for the
old man was the same individual who had rebuffed
him so bruskly at the depot.</p>

<p>“Hey!” called the old gentleman, without straightening
himself from the amazing position in which he
sat. “Hey, Dolf—Dolf Springer!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” the gentleman in the white socks grunted,
sitting erect and gazing about him owlishly.</p>

<p>“Was you at the depot to see the six-o’clock
come in, Dolf? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Calc’lated to be.”</p>

<p>“Anybody git off, Dolf? Anybody special?”</p>

<p>“Lafe Jenks and his wife, Mandy Williams, Tom
Sweet, two travelin’-men—”</p>

<p>“Anybody special, Dolf? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, last to git down was Michael Moran,
Judge.”</p>

<p>“Um! What become of him, Dolf? Happen to
notice?”</p>

<p>“In there eatin’ his supper.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late to be here long, Dolf?”</p>

<p>“Quite a spell, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late to be here till Moran comes out?”</p>

<p>“I could.”</p>

<p>“Um! Figger on speakin’ to him, Dolf?”</p>

<p>“Did think I might.”</p>

<p>“What was you goin’ to speak about? The
weather? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Not’s I know of, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Was you goin’ to mention me? Eh? Figger
on alludin’ to me?”</p>

<p>“Thought some of it.”</p>

<p>“As how, Dolf?”</p>

<p>“Thought I might mention you was askin’ after
him.”</p>

<p>“Um! Goin’ to tell him where I was headin’ for?
Eh? Think of doin’ that?”</p>

<p>“Figgered I’d mention you was to your office.”</p>

<p>“G’-by, Dolf.”</p>

<p>“G’-by, Judge.”</p>

<p>The old man clucked to his horse: “Giddap,
Tiffany! G’long there! Time’s passin’ rapid for
both of us. Don’t waste none of it. G’long!”
The equipage drew slowly away from the hotel and
proceeded down the street at a rate of speed which
came close to being no movement at all, until it
came to a halt again before a frame building at the
end of the block. Here the old man alighted,
hitched his horse as carefully as if the animal were
a two-year-old showing signs of a desire to bolt.
Then he went inside.</p>

<p>In ten minutes a man of middle age, not at all the
Diversity type of citizen, appeared in the doorway.
He was below medium height, sturdily built, with a
face of the aggressive-business-man variety. Dolf
Springer uncoiled by a mighty effort and rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Mr. Moran!” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Moran nodded curtly.</p>

<p>“Zaanan’s to his office. He wants to see you over
there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moran nodded again and walked briskly down
the street to the building before which stood the
ancient horse and vehicle. He had wasted no time
obeying the summons, and Jim wondered somewhat,
for Michael Moran did not appear to him a man who
was accustomed to run about at the beck and call of
old men in dilapidated buggies. He seemed rather a
person used to issuing orders and to exacting prompt
obedience.</p>

<p>He was curious, too, about the old man himself,
who, without uttering a word that could be construed
by a court of law as expressing his wishes in the
matter, had, nevertheless, directed Dolf Springer to
waylay Mr. Moran and give him a message. The
old man’s method was a splendid example of caution.
It delighted Jim and aroused his curiosity as to the
name and place in the world of the old fellow.</p>

<p>He made inquiries of a fellow-lounger on the piazza:</p>

<p>“Who is the old gentleman who drives a horse
named Tiffany—”</p>

<p>“Who? Hain’t been in Diversity township much,
have you? Guess not. That there’s Zaanan Frame,
justice of the peace. Been it nigh to thirty year,
and like to be it thirty year more.”</p>

<p>This was meager enough information, but Jim’s
informant seemed to think it ample, for he relapsed
into somnolent silence.</p>

<p>Jim was just rising with the intention of taking a
walk—that seeming to be the sole entertainment
offered by Diversity—when another buggy, dust-covered,
drawn by a team, stopped before the hotel,
and a small, wiry, exceedingly well-tailored old
gentleman, with white whiskers of the bank-president
type, alighted. He got down jauntily, springily,
pertly, and trotted up the steps.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe—Mr. James Ashe, Junior. Can anybody
direct me to him?”</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Ashe,” said Jim, stepping forward.</p>

<p>“Delighted to meet you, young man.” The dapper
little gentleman stood off at arm’s-length to appraise
him. “Don’t favor your daddy much. Foot
longer and two feet narrower.” He chuckled gaily.
“My name’s Welliver—Morton J. Welliver. Bet
you’ve heard of me, eh? Bet you’ve heard daddy
mention me once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Your name, with Mr. Jenkins’s and
Mr. Plum’s and Mr. Mannikin’s, is pretty average
familiar to me. I hope everything is satisfactory
at your plant.”</p>

<p>“Satisfactory? My boy, the Brockville Hardwood
Company is booming. Now’s the day for the
clothespin man. We’re at the top of the heap.
Prices up, competition down, market hungry. But
what’s this I hear about daddy? Wired him I
wanted to see him on clothespin business. He wired
back: ‘Out of the game. Son owns plant—lock, stock,
and barrel. Tell it to him.’ Now, what’s that mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what it says, I expect. Father has gone to
California with mother. The plant’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Clothespin Jimmy quit! Can’t believe it.
Thought he’d die with one foot on a maple log and
a clothespin in each hand. Well! Well! So you
and I have to talk business, eh?”</p>

<p>“If there’s any to talk,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s some—some. Where’ll we go to
do it?”</p>

<p>“We might walk out a piece and sit on a fence,”
said Jim, with a grin. “It’ll be more comfortable,
and we can argue and swing our arms better.”</p>

<p>“Good enough. Which way?”</p>

<p>They walked along, Welliver doing most of the
conversing. Indeed, it was Mr. Welliver’s habit to
do most of the conversing. He owned a great many
words and was willing to part with them freely—but
not unwisely. It was said by men in the business that
Mr. Welliver could keep you entertained for an
evening and not utter a word of what was on his
mind. Clothespin Jimmy once told him he was like
the what-d’ye-call-’em fish that squirted out a cloud
of ink and then hid in it.</p>

<p>“Guess we can stop here,” said Jim when they
arrived at a spot overlooking the flat on which the
new mills were rising. “That’s the plant below.”</p>

<p>“Um! Some bigger than the old one, eh? What’s
the idea? Going to take all the business away from
us old fellows?”</p>

<p>“I guess you and Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Plum and
Mr. Mannikin can look after your share, if all I’ve
heard is true.”</p>

<p>“We can try. We can try. And that, my boy,
is the very reason I’m here. I’m told you’re putting
in six more clothespin machines than you had in the
old plant.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“That means about one hundred and twenty-five
thousand additional five-gross boxes going on to the
market.”</p>

<p>“So father says.”</p>

<p>“Well, son, the Club don’t look on that with a
favorable eye. Of course you know the Club?”</p>

<p>“Clothespin Club? I know we’re members of it
with seven other mills.”</p>

<p>“But do you know what it has done for the
business? How it has taken a scramble of unprofitable
competition and turned it into a smooth-running
machine?”</p>

<p>“Something about it.”</p>

<p>“The Club meets—socially, of course, and nothing
to interest the Sherman Law fellows. But we
sort of talk things over friendly, and somebody
quotes a price on clothespins, and another fellow
says that sounds like a fair price, and they talk over
market conditions and go home. But they all stick
to the price mentioned. The last price was up-top,
and we’re all making hay. But we don’t want anything
to disturb the market.”</p>

<p>“Um!” said Jim, who was beginning to glean a
hint of Mr. Welliver’s object.</p>

<p>“Conditions are about right now. Any increase
in output will—unsettle matters.”</p>

<p>Jim remained silent.</p>

<p>“So,” said Mr. Welliver in his most friendly way,
“the Club had a little meeting—”</p>

<p>“Part of it,” interjected Jim.</p>

<p>“All but you,” said Mr. Welliver. “Yes, we met
casually, and talked it over, and here I am to advise
you against adding those extra machines.”</p>

<p>“You’re a bit late,” said Jim. “They’re added.”</p>

<p>“But you might find it more profitable not to
operate them. More money can be made with
twelve machines at present prices than with eighteen
and four or five tens lopped off.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Jim understood then. Mr. Welliver’s last observation
had not been an observation at all—it had been
a threat.</p>

<p>“You mean you’ll cut prices if I go ahead?” He
paused a moment. “You got together and decided
the Ashe Clothespin Company had bitten off all it
could chew, and this was a good time to sort of help
us run our business, eh?”</p>

<p>“We know how much you’ve put into these mills.
We know your daddy built them on the strength
of high prices, and we know that a drop in prices
will give you something to think about.”</p>

<p>“And your ultimatum is: Either we drop our six
new machines or you drop prices. Is that the
idea?”</p>

<p>“Something very like it.”</p>

<p>Jim got to his feet and stood over the dapper little
man. He looked large in the moonlight and Mr.
Welliver became uneasy in his mind. He contemplated
with negligible pleasure the idea of this
big young man’s losing his temper and rumpling him
all up. But Jim had no such idea.</p>

<p>“Mr. Welliver,” he said, “father gave me this
business and told me to run it. He didn’t tell me
to let the Club run it—and I’m not going to. You’ve
come here threatening me, and somehow I don’t take
to the idea of it. I know where I’m at and pretty
much what I’m up against, but just the same I’m
the Ashe Clothespin Company, and I’ll keep on
being it as long as there’s a company. I’ll run twelve
machines or eighteen or fifty, as I think it’s wise, and
if the Club doesn’t like it, why the Club can be
just as peevish as it wants to. I’ve never been in
a good fight yet. You seem to want to get into one,
and I’ll accommodate you for all I’ve got. Now,
then, here’s my proposition to the Club: It can go
on and run its own affairs and leave me alone—or it
can start a row. You can make your choice now.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“We can’t allow you to run those extra machines.”</p>

<p>“It’s war, then?”</p>

<p>“I hope not that, but we’ll have to point out to
you that one mill can’t upset the whole industry.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll point out to you that this mill can do
as it everlastingly pleases. Let’s go back to the
hotel. Is it shake hands or fight?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’ll have to be fight.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Jim said—and all of a sudden he felt
grimly glad, and a grimly glad smile lighted his face
“then I guess I’ll fire the first shot. Our inventory
shows we’ve got fifty thousand boxes in the old
warehouse. They go on the market to-morrow at
five tens off the present price—and if that doesn’t
suit you I’ll cut off another ten or so.”</p>

<p>“But—but, my boy, you’re crazy. You’ll lose
money on every box you sell.”</p>

<p>“So will you—and you’ve got more to sell than I
have just now. You can watch me send the telegram,”
Jim said.</p>

<p>“Young man, you’re a bit sudden,” said Mr.
Welliver.</p>

<p>“I may be sudden, sir, but you’ll find I’m lasting,
too. When this ruction calms down one of two
things will have happened: I’ll be busted or the Club
will have learned to stick to the purpose for which
it was formed.”</p>

<p>He turned and strode off toward the hotel, with
Mr. Welliver trotting at his heels, uttering bleating
sounds of protest. As they neared the piazza, he
said, pantingly: “Suppose we talk some more.
Maybe we can hit on a compromise.”</p>

<p>“The only compromise you can hit on is to keep
your hands off.”</p>

<p>Mr. Welliver shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good night, young man. I’m afraid you’re going
to be very sorry for this. Your father had more—discretion.”</p>

<p>“My father’s backbone reached from the base of
his skull to the seat of his pants,” said Jim, “and
every inch of it was stiff. Good night, Mr. Welliver.”</p>

<p>Inside he procured a telegraph blank and wrote a
brief message to the bookkeeper at the old office:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Notify all agents and customers price clothespins five tens
off list. Effective to-day.</p>

</div>

<p>Again something to do had arisen and Jim had
done it swiftly, suddenly. He had added fresh and
stronger claims on his new name.</p>

<h1 id='t1207'>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p>Jim awoke next morning to a sense not altogether
one of satisfaction with the events of the night
before. He realized he had inaugurated a clothespin
war which further parleying might have postponed or
prevented. Again he had acted swiftly, suddenly,
surprisingly to himself. Yet as he thought it over
he was less inclined to censure himself. He felt he
was right when he insisted on building and operating
his mill to suit himself—so long as he built and
operated with fairness. He knew Welliver and the
Club would not recede from their position, and that
there remained only to surrender, play for delay, or
fight. There is a certain satisfaction in striking
first.</p>

<p>Jim’s watch told him it would not be six o’clock
for another half-hour, and breakfast was not until
seven. He dressed leisurely and descended to the
piazza, where, grouped about the step of the buggy,
stood Welliver, Michael Moran, and the old justice
of the peace.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” called Welliver, chipper as a
wren. “You’re an early bird. Thought I’d have to
leave without saying good-by.”</p>

<p>“Hope you have a pleasant drive,” said Jim.
He turned down the walk and strode away with the
intention of tramping a mile or two before the dining-room
opened.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, son,” Welliver called. “Come
here and shake hands with Mr. Moran—you’ll be
meeting each other in a business way considerable.
He owns this thirty-mile streak of rust you call a
railroad. And Judge Frame.”</p>

<p>Jim shook hands. Moran returned his pressure
heartily; but, while he offered a cordial welcome to
Diversity, Jim was aware the man’s clear gray eyes
were studying and appraising him. As for Zaanan
Frame, he merely grunted.</p>

<p>“Haven’t had a change of heart since last night?”
asked Welliver.</p>

<p>Jim smiled and shook his head. “Our folks will
be quoting a discount of five tens this morning,” Be
said.</p>

<p>“Son, when you’ve been in this business twenty
years you’ll go slower.”</p>

<p>“Colts,” said Zaanan Frame, “kicks out the dashboard
jest for fun. But most gen’ally, when an old
hoss starts in to use his heels he means business.”</p>

<p>James said nothing. He was to discover that
Zaanan Frame was given to making remarks to
which it was difficult to retort; that Zaanan had a
way of dropping a statement over a conversation as
one would lower a candle-snuffer over the flame,
and that a new subject to talk about became immediately
desirable. The old justice was a final
sort of person. Jim’s dislike for him grew like one
of these huge white mushrooms which daring individuals
pick and fry and eat—and sometimes survive.</p>

<p>“You are determined?” asked Mr. Welliver, making
one last effort.</p>

<p>“I’m determined to run my own business,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>Mr. Welliver shrugged his erect and beautifully
tailored shoulders.</p>

<p>“When you’ve got enough—” he began, suggestively,
but did not trouble to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“Glad to have met you, gentlemen,” Jim said.
“I’m off for a walk to stir up enthusiasm for breakfast.”</p>

<p>A man who has to have his clothes wet through
before he can recognize it is raining may succeed as
a professor of Greek or as an artificer of a ditch,
but he is not likely to elbow aside numerous captains
of industry. Though unequipped with that which
the proverb declares to be the best teacher, Jim
Ashe did have in its proper place inside his skull a
brain reasonably able to travel from patent cause
to obvious effect, or to reach a conclusion that birds
which flock together are likely to be similarly feathered.
The height of stupidity for a man in Jim’s situation
would have been not to speculate on the manifest
acquaintance between Mr. Welliver, Michael
Moran, and Justice of the Peace Frame. He was
not guilty of that stupidity, and as he walked along
the road whose hot sands had cooled under the
summer moon, he speculated on the significance of
their early morning meeting. His thoughts ran
something to the effect that to a man up a tree it
looked as if Mr. Welliver had allies in the very heart
of the territory of the Ashe Clothespin Company.</p>

<p>Jim walked briskly past his mills, then turned into
an inviting lane which led upward toward a wood-lot.
Presently he turned again, to return cross-lots
along the hypotenuse of the triangle. To do this it
was necessary to surmount the first line of defense,
a five-strand, barb-wire fence, then to climb a knoll
surmounted by a lonely hickory-tree. From the top
of this knoll Jim hoped to have a general view of the
country and so to acquaint himself at a glance with
the topography of his new home. He scrambled up,
and reached the top breathless. The last dozen feet
had been steep, hiding the tiny plateau at the peak
from sight. Immediately he straightened up. He
was made to feel that he was not wholly welcome—indeed,
that he was decidedly an intruder, for frowning
at him with black brows and sullen black eyes
was the young woman at whom he had stared on the
station platform.</p>

<p>Her expression was hostile. If eyes and compressed
lips can speak, that young woman was saying
peremptorily and not at all politely, “Get out!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Jim panted. “I had no
idea—?”</p>

<p>“You must have seen me,” she said, coldly.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t see you,” said Jim. “I should not
have intruded.”</p>

<p>“This spot is visible for a mile in any direction,”
she said, shortly. Apparently she was determined
to believe he had seen her and had climbed up to
her, probably in the prosecution of the common masculine
ambition to scrape up acquaintance with a
stray and unprotected girl. Jim felt an embarrassing
warmth about his ears.</p>

<p>“You stared at me yesterday,” she said, before he
could speak.</p>

<p>“I did not stare at you,” he replied, unguardedly.
“I was staring at the expression in your eyes—the
hungry expression with which you looked after the
train.”</p>

<p>She bit her lips; her eyes darkened; she was
startled.</p>

<p>“Can people see it?” she asked, aloud, not of Jim,
not of herself, not of anybody or anything that
could frame an answer.</p>

<p>Jim ignored her exclamation and entered his defense.
“I was walking to pass the time till breakfast.
When I got to the wood-lot there I turned to cut
across lots. I did not see you. I had other things
on my mind than unexpected young women on
hilltops at unholy hours in the morning. I am sorry
I disturbed you.” He did not go, but stood looking
down at her. She was looking past him down the
valley toward the distant shimmer that was the
great lake. For the moment he was negligible to
her; again her eyes, her face, wore that expression
as of the woman in the bread-line—of hunger.</p>

<p>In a moment her face relaxed till it spoke merely
of discontent, dissatisfaction. Jim thought she
would have been homely were it not for the graceful
setting of her head on her shoulders, the splendid
ease and symmetry of her position.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to explain to every chance stranger
why I get up early in the morning and come here,”
she said, not so much sullenly as with repression, as
though she were damming up something within her.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Jim, inadequately.</p>

<p>Suddenly she flashed to her feet with a beautiful
litheness and stood facing him, her hands clenched
into little fists, her breast heaving.</p>

<p>“I will tell you. I’ve got to tell somebody. It’s
because I hate this”—she swept her hand over
Diversity. “It’s because it’s horrible, unbearable.
It’s because I’m chained down here like a prisoner
in a dungeon. That’s why I go to watch the train—it
is going away, going out there where people live.
That’s why I come up here. It’s my little window
to look out of. I can see beyond Diversity. Sometimes
a vessel passes. I imagine I am on it, going
away—to Chicago—to New York—to San Francisco.
Here I can turn my back on Diversity and see where
its dead hand cannot reach. I hate the town, I hate
the people, but most of all I hate the children.
Oh, look shocked! But sit in a room with thirty of
them ten months a year; watch their smugness; try
to cram spelling and geography and arithmetic into
them; try to make an impression on their dullness.
They’re a nightmare! That’s why I come here—to
look away from them, beyond them, to see a spot
that’s not tainted with them. I was born here.”
She said the last as though it were the summing up
of all evil.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” said Jim, in a tone that was
ludicrously paternal, “you’re working yourself up
to—hysterics or something.”</p>

<p>She leaned against the old hickory-tree, panting,
clutching the folds of her skirt with convulsive
fingers.</p>

<p>“I want to go—go—go! I want to see things—to
be a part of them. I’m smothered. This is
living in a graveyard where there’s a perpetual fog.
Other people live. Other people have things happen
to them, and I—I don’t even dare read about
them in books. I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>Jim wanted to run, yet he wanted to stay. Here
was a manifestation far outside the purview of his
experience. It was a little adventure into a human
soul, and Jim’s contact with the human soul had been
superficial.</p>

<p>“If you want to go, why—why in thunder don’t
you go?” he said, boyishly.</p>

<p>She flashed a gleam of scorn upon him.
“I’m a girl—a girl—the most helpless, most defenseless,
most easily damaged thing under the sun.
Why don’t I go?” Her tone snapped with scorn.
“What would I do? Who would take me in? What
would become of me? Here I’m safe. I may die
of it, but I’m safe. It might be less hideously barren
if I weren’t. I’m alone. I’ve been alone since I
was fifteen. Some day it’ll be too much for me and
I’ll go. But I won’t be fooled into it. I’ll go with
my eyes open, knowing why I go. If I go nobody’ll
be to blame—except Diversity—for I’ll have made
my choice deliberately. Don’t look shocked. I
suppose there have been millions of others before me
who had the same choice to make. I’m not unique.
You men have made the world, and when you get
a glimpse of it once in a while you’re shocked.”</p>

<p>“Miss”—Jim paused and bit his finger in
bewilderment—“I don’t just know what you’re accusing us
men of, nor the world in general. But I’ve lived a
bit more than you. I’ve lived enough to know this—that
there’s more good than evil. There are more
folks who are trying to do right than who deliberately
do wrong. I know that even in the bad ones there’s
more good than bad. I believe if you were to take
all the law and machinery of the law, all the police,
all the social protection out of the world to-day, that
to-morrow the force for right which is in the world
would assert itself. There is so much more good than
bad in the world that the bad would be held down
by the mere weight of the good. You hear about the
evil, because the evil thing is news, something to
talk about, something to make readers for the newspapers.
And it’s news because it’s out of the normal.
So there seems to be a lot more bad than there
is. Goodness is normal—so normal that nobody
notices it.”</p>

<p>“Men always defend themselves plausibly.”</p>

<p>“I’m not defending men; I’m defending humanity.”</p>

<p>She fell silent, and gazed past him again to the
twinkling blue of the lake. When she spoke it was
less hardily, more wistfully than she had spoken
before:</p>

<p>“The world is so big and so interesting. In any
direction, if my eyes reached far enough, they would
see something thrilling. To think there is so much—and
I am refused a crumb!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid something has happened to disturb
you.”</p>

<p>She laughed shortly. “If something should I’d
thank Heaven for it! It’s all so drowsy, so placid,
and I’m tied to it as if to a stake, with a slow fire
lighted round me.”</p>

<p>“But if you want to go so badly, if life here is so
unendurable, what ties you to it?”</p>

<p>“The trifling accident of having been born a girl,
added to the trifling episode of having lost my
parents, added to the inconsequential condition that
the forty dollars a month I get for teaching school
is all that stands between me and starvation.”</p>

<p>She turned abruptly from him and started down
the knoll. He followed.</p>

<p>“Don’t come with me,” she said, stopping. “I
don’t know you. I don’t want to know you. After
this I never want to see you again. I had to say
these things to somebody. By accident it was you,
but I hate you for it. You know. Never try to
speak to me.”</p>

<p>She went away swiftly, leaving him to stare after
her in bewilderment. He was startled. His sensation
was such as if he had picked up a pebble and
found it suddenly to be a live coal.</p>

<p>Later in the day he found her name to be Marie
Ducharme, daughter of a French-Canadian lumber-lack
who had risen to be a walking boss. He found
that Diversity returned her dislike, or, if it did not
return it, viewed her askance as a person who was
“queer.”</p>

<p>To be “queer” in a village of less than a thousand
souls is no inconsiderable crime.</p>

<h1 id='t1540'>CHAPTER V</h1>

<p>For the next fortnight Jim Ashe was too busy to
give thought to his new environment, to study
the new world to which he had been translated. He
was studying the clothespin business. It is true he
did not come to his work wholly unprepared; being
Clothespin Jimmy’s son, that was impossible. His
father had talked it, thought it, dreamed it. Jim
had assimilated it with his meals. Also, as a boy,
before his college days, in vacation times when college
days arrived, he had worked in the mills and
acquired for the business that distaste which he
once vainly fancied was to lead him down widely
different vocational paths.</p>

<p>As a lad he had counted and packed pins; later
he had dogged in the sawmill; one vacation he had
calloused and slivered his hands feeding the drum.
He had scaled timber; he had been chore-boy for old
Pazzy Miller, the pinmaker. These various jobs
were given him out of his father’s wisdom to show
him the how and the why of all steps in the manufacture.
Nor was he ignorant of other branches of
the business, for clothespins were not the sole product,
though they were its backbone. He was not unacquainted
with the mysteries of the veneer lathe nor
with the making of wood ashes. He understood
somewhat the technic of the turner, and the processes
which went to the making of wooden spoons, rolling-pins,
drumsticks, and the like—all turned from
seasoned lumber.</p>

<p>Those things he knew as a workman. Something
of the marketing problems his father had been able
to drop unsuspected into his mind, but this was all
incoherent, not card-indexed and pigeonholed and
ready for instant use. Jim spent his time—not
occupied by immediately pressing concerns and
events—in preparing the knowledge he had, in adding
to it; in short, in preparing himself as best he
could to handle and husband the property that was
his. It was surprisingly like trying to swim after a
course of twenty lessons from a correspondence
school.</p>

<p>A week before the machinery was ready to turn
over, the office force with its paraphernalia arrived
from the old office and was installed in the new.
It consisted of one stenographer, picked by Clothespin
Jimmy wholly for efficiency and not at all for
adornment; of a middle-aged bookkeeper, who
seemed to have been born with something more than
the normal quantity of organs, for there grew from
his forehead a green eye-shade, without which he was
never seen, and there sprouted in his right hand a
pen. There was also an assistant bookkeeper, whose
business in life was to act and look as much like the
bookkeeper, Mr. Grierson, as possible; and a shipping-clerk,
whose familiarity with freight-rates and
with the occult business of routing freight-cars so
they would arrive where they were intended to go,
instead of at the other side of the continent, was
such as to arouse Jim’s admiration.</p>

<p>The clothespin war was as yet a minor trouble.
He had one letter from the secretary of the Club,
informing him that the price he had quoted was cut
by another five per cent. This cut he met immediately.
A flood of orders came in from brokers,
traveling-men, wholesalers—all rushing to take advantage
of the low market to stock up. These Jim
culled over carefully, accepting only enough to keep
his plant running to capacity, not overloading himself
with orders which he would have to fill in case of
a cessation of hostilities and consequent soaring of
price.</p>

<p>He called into conference his superintendent, millwright,
master mechanic, and the foremen of his departments,
but it was not a conference, as the event
proved. It consisted merely of a brief statement by
Jim.</p>

<p>“The job you fellows are up against,” he said, “is
to manufacture better and cheaper than anybody
else. Prices are down. I believe we can still show
a profit. Any man who has an idea that will save
a tenth of a cent on a box of pins will find it profitable
to bring it to me. What’s the best day’s average
you made in the old plant, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five boxes a machine,” said the old pinmaker.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting eighty here,” Jim told him. “It
costs as much to operate a machine making sixty
boxes as it does eighty. If you can make eighty, the
extra five will come close to being profit. Don’t let
a machine, a lathe, a saw, waste machine hours.
Everything has got to run; it has got to run constantly,
and it has got to produce the greatest quantity
that is physically possible. I’m depending on
you men. We have a new crew in large part. I
want them to feel I’m depending on them. Tell
every girl, every man of the crew, that the Ashe
Clothespin Company is depending on her or on him,
and that each may depend on me. If I expect them
to give me a square deal, I expect myself to give them
a square deal. Tell them that. There’ll be no dissatisfaction
or labor trouble here if I can help it—and
I can. I guess that’s all. Now get at it.”</p>

<p>The men looked at one another; old Pete scratched
his head and grinned, and they filed out. Their
feeling, if one was to judge from their faces, was one
of satisfaction and confidence. They believed in the
new boss, and that is the first step toward a feeling
of affection.</p>

<p>It was that afternoon that Zaanan Frame drove his
old horse Tiffany—named, as Jim found out, after
the greatest of legal books,
Tiffany’s <span class='it'>Justices’ Guide</span>—up to
the mill and rheumatically climbed to the
office.</p>

<p>“Afternoon,” said he. “Name’s Jim, hain’t it?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded curtly. He suspected the justice of
being no friend of his, but an ally of the other camp.</p>

<p>“All right, Jim. Last names was made for fellers
that git to be postmasters. Couldn’t sort the mail
without ’em. Hain’t for every-day use no more ’n
plug hats.”</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Judge?” Jim asked,
offishly.</p>

<p>The old fellow regarded him a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, you might put more sugar into your
coffee. Need sweet’nin’ up. Still livin’ to the hotel,
eh? All the comforts of home? Suits you to a tee?”</p>

<p>“The meals are all right,” said Jim, unbending a
trifle, “but that’s all you can say.”</p>

<p>“Um! What’s home without a motto over the
door? Hain’t met Mis’ Stickney? Course not.
Widder woman twice repeated. Machinery runnin’?
Um! Got her goin’ quicker ’n folks expected.”</p>

<p>“We hurried things up a bit.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Never seen sich a woman as the
Widder Stickney for house-cleanin’. Best housekeeper
in the county. Mill makes a heap of difference
in Diversity. Kind of irritatin’ to Lafe
Meggs up to the store. Says somebody’s always
comin’ in and disturbin’ him to buy somethin’ or
other. Calc’lates he’ll have to hire a clerk. Lafe’s
ambitions mostly requires a sittin’ posture.”</p>

<p>“How big is this town, Judge?”</p>

<p>“About a dozen people and five hundred folks.
Take in the newspaper, Jim?”</p>

<p>“I take a Grand Rapids paper.”</p>

<p>“Take in the Diversity paper, Jim?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Um! Comes out Thursdays. Int’restin’ readin’
into it sometimes. The Widder Stickney got her
second husband on the strength of her cookin’.
Calc’late she could git a third with it, but she allows
husbands is so fleetin’ and funeral expenses is so
high ’twouldn’t hardly pay. Name of the paper is
the <span class='it'>Diversity Eagle</span>. Business perty good, eh?
Keepin’ up brisk?”</p>

<p>“We manage to keep from loafing.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Loafin’s the leadin’ sport here.
Calc’late Dolf Springer’s our champion jest now.
Interestin’ piece in the paper this week. Several
interestin’ pieces. Don’t take it in, eh? Early
riser, hain’t you? See you walkin’ ’fore breakfast.”</p>

<p>Jim wondered if the old justice had any ulterior
meaning in this observation. He had arisen early
each morning and tramped out into the country.
Sometimes he had been close to admitting to himself
that this was not wholly for the air and exercise. Indeed,
he had wondered if something much more material
and human had not been at the root of the
matter. There, for instance, was that young woman
whom he had encountered on top of the knoll.
She walked of mornings, too—and she was an interesting
if not attractive individual. She puzzled
him. He even went so far as to be vaguely anxious
about her, for her state of mind had not appealed
to him as one conducive to normal and conventional
behavior. He wondered if Zaanan Frame knew of
that encounter, or knew of that subsequent meeting—and
passing—a week later when Miss Ducharme
had come face to face with him at a turn of the road
and had gone by with nothing to indicate she was
aware of his existence except a scornful flash of her
black eyes.</p>

<p>“Somebody was sayin’,” he heard Zaanan observe,
“that the Widder Stickney had a spare room she was
thinkin’ of rentin’. Yes, sir, if I was goin’ to read the
<span class='it'>Diversity Eagle</span> I figger this week’s issue’d be the one
I’d look for. Um! Calc’late Tiffany’s tired of
standin’. Have to humor him. Powerful high-spirited
boss. Second-floor room on the front, it
was. G’-by, Jim. <span class='it'>Eagle</span> office is next to Lafe
Meggs’s store.”</p>

<p>The old man went out, and it seemed as if he
creaked in every joint. Jim heard him pass slowly
along the hall and out of the door—and wondered
what his visit meant. He reviewed the rambling
conversation as best he could; found that in spite
of himself he was attracted by Zaanan’s personality.
But why had the old fellow come? What had he
talked about? Why, about the Widow Stickney and
her room, and about the <span class='it'>Diversity Eagle</span>. Jim was
not yet familiar with Zaanan Frame’s methods, but
it did seem clear to him that the old justice wanted
him to go to board with Mrs. Stickney; wanted him
also to read the current issue of the <span class='it'>Eagle</span>.</p>

<p>That evening Jim procured a copy of the <span class='it'>Eagle</span>.
Its leading article gave the news that Michael Moran
had purchased a controlling interest in the Diversity
Hardwood Company, and had been elected its president
in the place of Henry W. Green, resigned. This
was worth while. It was important, for the prosperity
of the Ashe Clothespin Company depended
on the Diversity Hardwood Company. It was the
latter that furnished the birch, beech, and maple
from which the clothespins were manufactured. It
was with that company that Clothespin Jimmy had
negotiated a twenty-year timber contract calling for
the delivery in his mill-yard of not less than five
millions nor more than ten millions of feet of timber
a year. Pursuant to this contract the new mills
had been erected. Here was news indeed. What
did it signify? What would be its results that
touched Jim Ashe? And why had Zaanan Frame
wanted him to be apprised—warned—of the event?
If Zaanan’s hint to read the paper was of such
undoubted value, would not his other suggestion be
worth looking into? Jim thought so, and inquired
his way to the Widow Stickney’s. She occupied a
pleasant, maple-shaded house surrounded by riotous
flower-beds and more practical kitchen gardens. It
was attractive with the flavor of home. Jim rang the
bell.</p>

<p>The result of his call and inspection was that he
rented from the widow her second-floor front and
arranged to be fed at her table. As he was leaving
she hesitated, hemmed, and hawed, as Clothespin
Jimmy would have put it, and finally said:</p>

<p>“I got one other boarder. Jest one. Hain’t no
objections to that, have you?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, Mrs. Stickney,” said Jim, which
was perfectly true. He had neither objections nor
curiosity regarding the fact. However, as he walked
between the flower-beds to the gate some one turned
in and approached him. He looked up, felt himself
draw a little sudden breath of surprise, for the individual
was Marie Ducharme. Jim knew instantly
that she was the other boarder. She passed him,
cheeks slightly flushed, eyes straight ahead, without
deigning to look at him. He felt a warmth about his
ears.</p>

<p>That evening he sat late on the hotel piazza, working
on a puzzle.</p>

<p>He could not piece it together. Why had Zaanan
Frame wanted him to know of Michael Moran’s new
business venture? But, even more difficult of solution,
why had Zaanan wanted him to board with the
Widow Stickney?</p>

<p>Marie Ducharme insisted on obtruding herself into
his puzzlings. It was absurd, he knew, but had she
anything to do with the matter?</p>

<h1 id='t1840'>CHAPTER VI</h1>

<p>On the day the mills commenced operating Jim
Ashe called for a statement of the company’s
condition from Mr. Grierson. As Jim expected, it
proved to be disquieting. The facts were that the
mills had cost upward of two hundred thousand
dollars; there was still owing for machinery and materials
some thirty thousand dollars; there was seven
thousand dollars cash in the bank. The weekly payroll
was over two thousand dollars. Other operating
expenses, with the cost of supplies and timber,
brought this sum up to five thousand dollars a week—and
as yet not a penny’s worth of manufactured
product had been turned out or shipped.</p>

<p>“According to this,” Jim said to Mr. Grierson,
“we can run a week. Then what?”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mr. Grierson, his voice dry and
rattling like one of the leaves of his ledger, “we’ll
have to have some more money.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jim, grimly, “that’s all there is to it,
eh? Well, where’ll we get it? Supposing we are
able to begin shipments by the end of next week—how
soon can we expect returns?”</p>

<p>“Thirty days at the best.”</p>

<p>“And in that thirty days we’ll be spending nearly
thirty thousand dollars—which we haven’t got. I
have heard of working capital before, but I never
comprehended what a pleasant thing it was to have.
Where does one get money, Grierson?”</p>

<p>“From the bank.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I guess I’m beginning to understand
what father was talking about when he said he milked
the business. That fifty thousand of his would make
a fine plug to put in this hole. But that’s gone. If
I know father, he took it to make me hustle. His
sense of humor works that way. Well, I’ll see what
I can puzzle out, Grierson.”</p>

<p>Jim was in a measure prepared to be helmsman of
his commercial ship, so far as the manufacturing
and selling of his wares were concerned; but when
the vessel entered financial waters, with a storm
blowing and a tortuous channel to thread, he felt he
ought to toot the whistle frantically and signal for a
pilot. But there was no pilot to be had. There was
nothing for it but to slow down and dodge through
the reefs, taking frequent soundings with the lead of
good judgment, striving with his eyes to pierce the
vexed waters for hidden rocks. In short, the time
had arrived to spread the bread of uncertainty with
the butter of optimism.</p>

<p>He must have money. Two methods of procuring
it presented themselves, but he liked the features of
neither of them. The first was to borrow—if possible;
the second, to sell stock. Without hesitation
he eliminated the latter. He put on his hat, stopped
long enough in the outer office to tell Grierson he was
going to the bank, and went out.</p>

<p>He handed his card to Mr. Wills, cashier of the
institution, and Mr. Wills shook hands with him in
the manner that cashiers shake hands with individuals
who are to deposit some hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year with them.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Mr. Ashe. I was wondering
when you’d find time to drop in to see us.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ve got lots of money, now that I am
here,” said Jim, with specious confidence.</p>

<p>“Enough to warrant us in locking the vault,” said
Mr. Wills. “Anything special we can do for you
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jim, “you could lend me a few dollars.”</p>

<p>“Your father said you might be wanting to borrow,”
said Mr. Wills. “He had, as you know, of
course, a conference with our board this spring, and
we stand ready to do what we can for you. We’re
a small bank, you know. Some of our directors were
against making a loan of any size to a corporation,
but Zaanan Frame and Mr. Moran were in favor—which
wound up that ball of string. How much will
you be wanting?”</p>

<p>“Thirty thousand dollars,” said Jim, half expecting
the cashier to jump to his feet and call a strong assistant
to escort him to the street.</p>

<p>“That’s just inside the limit. Need it right away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wills fumbled in a pigeonhole and passed
Jim a note.</p>

<p>“Make this out, sign it as an officer of your company,
and put your personal indorsement on the
back. It’s a demand note, you observe. We prefer
that kind.”</p>

<p>Jim wasn’t clear just what the difference was between
that kind and the other. It didn’t matter.
He was going to get the money he needed—without
an effort. It was a shock to him. Were money
matters arranged thus easily? Was money in considerable
sums so easy to come by? He signed the
note, and was told the amount would be credited to
his accounts as of that day.</p>

<p>After he had chatted a moment, and thanked Mr.
Wills as profusely as he believed it wise, he turned
away. But a sudden recollection stopped him.
Mr. Wills had said Zaanan Frame and Mr. Moran
had favored the loan. Did you ever eat cherry pie,
delicious cherry pie, and suddenly encounter a pit
which the cook had overlooked? Jim felt much the
same way.</p>

<p>“What Mr. Moran is on your board?” he asked.</p>

<p>Wills looked his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, Michael Moran, of course!” he said.</p>

<p>As Jim turned off the road on to the mill lot, a man
two inches shorter than he and four inches broader
accosted him.</p>

<p>“You’re Mr. Ashe, ain’t you?” the man asked.</p>

<p>Jim nodded and stopped. The man, who wore a
calico shirt that, stout as it was, threatened to rip
out at the seams when the big muscles played beneath,
was an individual whose life had not fallen in
places of ease. Work, hard work, had made him.
He had triumphed over it. His will and a splendid
body had triumphed, until Jim paid the tribute of
his admiration to the result of it.</p>

<p>“Got any place for a cant-hook man?”</p>

<p>“I think we can use one in the log-yard. Out of
a job?”</p>

<p>“Walked out of it. When I heard Mike Moran
was goin’ to run the Diversity Hardwood outfit I
quit—sudden.”</p>

<p>Jim waited.</p>

<p>“I worked for him three year back on the South
Branch.” The man spat savagely in the dust.
“Self-respectin’ lumberjack wouldn’t ’a’ stayed
twenty-four hours gittin’ what some of them fellers
got. Me, it wasn’t so bad. ‘What was the matter?’
says you. ‘Plenty,’ says I. First, he starts in gittin’
rid of as good a crew as ever stuck their legs under
a cook-shanty table, and filled up the woods with
Polacks and Italians and Hunkies. Just critters
with arms and laigs like folks. Grub was rotten—rotten!
Them poor foreigners got it comin’ and
goin’. Knocked round, fed spoiled meat—and then
cheated out of their pay. Oh, foreigners hain’t the
only ones that’s been cheated out of their pay in
Michigan camps. I wisht I had what was comin’ to
me fair, Mr. Ashe. Why, I knowed two Polacks
that come out of Moran’s Camp Three, after workin’
from November till April—and they come out owin’
him eighteen dollars!”</p>

<p>“Now, now,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“I’m tellin’ the truth. Wanigan. Jest robbed
off’n ’em. Get a plug of tobacco at the wanigan—charged
for six. Like that. And fines. No wonder
he’s gittin’ richer ’n hell. Gittin’ out his timber
don’t cost him nothin’ to speak of. Men like him
is drivin’ real woodsmen out of Michigan. You can
go so far with robbin’ an Irishman or a Norwegian
or a Nova-Scotian—and then somethin’ busts. But
with them lingo-talkin’ foreigners, why there hain’t
no fight to ’em. And he’ll do the same here. ’Fore
another spring the camps’ll be full of ’em—and
him robbin’ ’em. I’ve heard ugly things of Mike
Moran. Not dealin’s with men, I mean. I’ve had
stories whispered to me by men I believed. And
one I know is so. Ask somebody that knows what
become of Susie Gilders. I calc’late some girl’s dad
or brother’ll be splittin’ Mike Moran with an ax
one of these days. But I’m talkin’ too much, Mr.
Ashe. Didn’t figger to git off on this rig. How
about that job?”</p>

<p>“Report to the superintendent. Tell him I sent
you. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Tim Bennett.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tim, I don’t know you and you don’t know
me, but I’d hate to have you think about me as you
do about Moran. I’ll try to see you don’t. These
are my mills, and the crew are working for me—but
that doesn’t mean any man or girl is to be afraid of
me. If anything goes wrong, tell me. Once I
wanted to do something besides run a clothespin-mill.
I wanted to see if I couldn’t turn in and do
something for these Polacks and Hunkies and
Italians—something that would change them from
being foreigners into Americans. But I couldn’t
have my way. But this much I can do—I can see
that the folks who work for me get a square deal.
You’ll find the superintendent back by the log-slide.”</p>

<p>Tim hesitated a moment, seemed to have something
more to say, but to find difficulty saying it.
Finally he blurted out: “Say, Mr. Ashe, I b’lieve
you and me is goin’ to get on.”</p>

<p>Jim recognized the compliment; it was no small
one.</p>

<p>“I hope so, Tim,” he said.</p>

<p>Jim sat down in his chair before his desk and
scowled at the wall. Michael Moran—everywhere
that name obtruded itself—Michael Moran and
Zaanan Frame. The pair of them seemed to impend
over the Ashe Clothespin Company like twin thunderclouds,
threatening, possessed of destructive potentialities.
They had met, conferred with Morton
Welliver after that gentlemen had delivered his
ultimatum. Had that conference concerned him?
Jim believed it had. Just what harm Zaanan Frame
was potent to cause, Jim did not know; but Moran—Moran
owned the little railroad, the sole outlet
for Jim’s wares; he controlled the lumber company
from which came Jim’s logs; his voice was preponderating
in the bank to which Jim owed thirty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>A thought came to Jim: If he could buy Moran’s
logs and pay Moran a profit on them—and then himself
manufacture them into clothespins and realize
another profit—how great would be Moran’s profit
if in his own mills he manufactured clothespins
from his own logs! Jim believed that in Moran’s
place he would covet the Ashe Clothespin Company.
And Moran’s various activities showed him to be an
acquisitive individual. But nowhere had Moran
manifested an unfriendly spirit; indeed, he had been
distinctly friendly in the matter of the loan. What
then? In any event, Jim told himself, it would not
be time wasted to keep a clear eye on the man and,
if possible, to rear in advance defenses against his
possible attack.</p>

<p>Presently he got up and went into the outer office,
where Grierson and his assistant were making occult
entries in black and red ink on the pages of huge
books. These tomes, in which were recorded the
daily history of business transactions, always affected
Jim with a feeling of awe, and secretly he had
for Grierson and his young man a profound admiration.
Anybody who could make all those entries
and add all those figures, and then, a month afterward,
have the slightest idea what all the agglomeration
was about, was possessed of some divine spark
akin to genius!</p>

<p>“Grierson,” said Jim, “have you ever made the
acquaintance of the creature known as a demand
note?”</p>

<p>“Not personally, I thank Heaven,” Grierson said,
piously.</p>

<p>“But you know its habits?”</p>

<p>“You’re joking, Mr. Ashe.” Anything akin to
humor was not to be tolerated when it touched a
thing so sacred as one of the bits of business impedimenta.</p>

<p>“I’m exceedingly serious. What can you tell me
of the habits and personal peculiarities of the thing?”</p>

<p>“A demand note,” said Grierson, with musty
gravity, “is a negotiable instrument running for an
indefinite period. It differs from a time note in that
it may be presented and payment demanded”—he
accented the word “demanded” in a manner that Jim
thought vindictive—“at any time the holder chooses.
Am I clear?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly—and disquietingly. I am to understand
that if you give a man a demand note he
may drop in on you casually whenever the notion
seizes him and make you—er—in the undignified
language of the soap salesman, come across? Is
that it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Grierson nodded, frowned, peered anxiously
at his ledger as if he feared a figure or two might
sneak away from him while his attention was distracted.</p>

<p>“Can you say anything cheerful about one of
them?” Jim persisted.</p>

<p>“The only cheerful thing about a demand note,
Mr. Ashe, is to know you are able to pay it whenever
it turns up—which most people are not.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Jim, “is an observation made from
great depths of wisdom.”</p>

<p>“I hope, Mr. Ashe, you have not been making any
demand paper.”</p>

<p>“Your hope is vain, Grierson. The thing is done.
The sword is suspended over my head. I am now
speculating on the possibility of certain gentlemen
cutting the hair that holds it.”</p>

<p>He went back to his desk again with the intention
of boring into the inwardness of the situation, but,
strangely, his mind showed a disposition to wander.
It skipped offishly away from demand notes and
speculations regarding Michael Moran; was drawn
again and again where Jim did not want it to go—and
where it would not be welcome. Of the latter he
was sure. For it was Marie Ducharme who obtruded
and elbowed aside more serious matters.</p>

<p>Jim moved to the Widow Stickney’s that night.
He wondered how Miss Ducharme would regard his
coming. Doubtless it would not decrease the ill will
she felt toward him. Doubtless she would regard it
as an impertinent intrusion. What did it matter
how she regarded it? He said that to himself, but
somehow he could not quite convince himself that he
said it with all sincerity.</p>

<h1 id='t2193'>CHAPTER VII</h1>

<p>The rural individual, riding for the first time on a
descending elevator, experiences a sensation that
leads to a fixed preference for stairs. It is a peculiar
sensation. It may be reproduced in less degree
psychologically. For instance, the boy on his way
to the woodshed with his father and a razor-strop
knows it; the young man about to announce to her
father his ambition to become a son-in-law is acquainted
with it. It comes to many people as they
approach the unknown, the dreaded, the long-sought-after.
It is a mingling of excitement, apprehension,
anticipation, and the three of them do not mingle
in peace. They seem, indeed, to have a most lively
and troublesome time of it in the region known as the
pit of the stomach.</p>

<p>As Jim left his room to go down to his first breakfast
at the Widow Stickney’s table he experienced an
unmistakable attack of it. Marie Ducharme was the
cause. Doubtless they would breakfast together.
He was a bit apprehensive as to how it would go off.
There was a certain amount of curiosity-incited
anticipation of a second meeting with her, a second
opportunity to glimpse her queer, disturbed, turbulent
personality. Let there be no error here—Jim
Ashe was not drawn toward Marie Ducharme.
Quite the contrary. She was not at all the sort of
person who would attract him; and her present
frame of mind was not such as to magnetize any
healthy young man. But she was a girl; she was a
step beyond the ordinary; she had a personality that
one could not encounter and escape unaffected.
That was all.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment in the hall, and then
entered the dining-room, where the widow and Marie
Ducharme were already at the table.</p>

<p>“Right here, Mr. Ashe,” said the widow; “take
this here chair with the arms and the cushion into it.
It’ll seem sort of queer to see a man settin’ into it
agin. My first used it and my second used it.”</p>

<p>“And you keep it in case it might be needed
again,” said Jim, gravely.</p>

<p>The widow shook her head. “’Tain’t nothin’ but
a memento no more. Husbands is all right, but
enough’s enough. What a body can want of more ’n
two is more ’n I can see. Let me make you acquainted
with Miss Ducharme, Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>Miss Ducharme nodded coldly.</p>

<p>“Cream ’n’ sugar?” asked the widow.</p>

<p>“Some cream, a good deal of sugar, and a little
coffee,” said Jim, stealing a look at the young
woman. She was stirring her coffee, a process which
appeared to require concentration. Jim didn’t
blame her for stirring it or for doing anything else
which would bring to public attention a hand as
graceful and shapely as hers. Her face, beneath a
stack of blackest hair, was expressionless.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe hain’t goin’ to bite you, Marie,” said
the widow, with a note of exasperation in her voice.
Jim was glad he had not taken a swallow of coffee,
for he could not have been responsible for consequences.</p>

<p>Miss Ducharme raised her eyes slowly, looked for
an instant into Jim’s eyes. “Nobody’s going to bite
me if I can help it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stickney is right,” said Jim, “I’m not
vicious. I almost never bite strangers. Still, I
might wear a muzzle if it would help matters.”</p>

<p>Miss Ducharme made no reply save a faint movement
of her shoulders—inherited from an ancestor
who had served Frontenac. She finished her coffee
and toast and egg slowly, arose silently, and left the
room. The widow looked after her a moment with
compressed lips.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” she said, “she’s that cantankerous
my hand fairly itches to come against her ear.
Seems she might ’a’ acted a leetle prettier, bein’s
you’re a stranger and this is your first meal.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it worry you, Mrs. Stickney.”</p>

<p>“Worry me! Huh! ’Tain’t worry that ails me,
it’s bein’ that provoked with her. She’s lived with
me since her folks died. She was fifteen then. I
couldn’t make her out as a child and a Philadelphy
lawyer couldn’t make her out as a woman. She’s
been gittin’ worse. Marie’s a good girl, Mr. Ashe—better
’n a lot of these mealy-mouthed, bowin’-and-scrapin’
ones—and Lord knows she’s smarter.
Too dum smart, I call her, for her own good. But
she’s queer. Kind of knurly. She don’t appear to
like folks, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, Mrs. Stickney, the trouble is that she
doesn’t like herself.”</p>

<p>“She gits on my mind. Sometimes I’m afeard
she’s goin’ to mess up what chances of happiness she’s
got. She sets and thinks too much, and some of the
things she says would fair shock you out of your
shoes. If I thought she meant ’em, old as she is
I’d take her acrost my knee and see if a slipper
wouldn’t change her point of view some.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’ll promise not to quarrel with her,
Mrs. Stickney,” said Jim, rising. He felt it was not
altogether ethical to discuss Miss Ducharme thus
freely. The widow seemed to have no such scruples.
Indeed, she was willing at all times and seasons to
discuss anybody, absent or present, and to put into
frank and expressive terms her thoughts concerning
them. The widow was no gossip, no backbiter, but
a woman of opinions and a nimble tongue undeterred
by fear or favor.</p>

<p>“A husband’s what she needs,” said she. “One
with enough disposition to go so far’s to lay his hand
on her if she went past his patience. I mind my
first husband shakin’ me once. I was young, then,
with notions. Dun’no’s anythin’ ever done me so
much good. ’Tain’t considered proper no more—but
if there was more shakin’s there’d be fewer
divorcin’s.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps our men are deteriorating under the influences
of modern life,” Jim suggested, with a
twinkle in his eye. “The headship of the family is
passing to the other sex.”</p>

<p>“Then men ought to be up and doin’ somethin’
about it,” said the widow. “I wouldn’t give shucks
for a man that let a woman run him. All this here
talk about emancipatin’ wimmin makes me sick to
my stummick. Wimmin don’t need emancipatin’.
What they need is bossin’. I’ve been a woman
consid’able of a spell and I calc’late I ought to
know.”</p>

<p>“I think my grandmother would agree with you
if she were living.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’m grandmother to six. My idee is
that wimmin don’t git settled and sensible till they
turn sixty.”</p>

<p>“I’m in favor of giving the vote to all grandmothers.”</p>

<p>“It would fetch consid’able sense into elections,”
said the widow. “Don’t hurry off. I like to talk—maybe
you’ve noticed it.”</p>

<p>“And enjoyed it,” said Jim, passing through the
door.</p>

<p>Miss Ducharme was putting on her hat in the hall.
Jim’s first thought was to pass on without pause;
his second and better thought was to parley.</p>

<p>“I’m waving a flag of truce, Miss Ducharme,” he
said. “Can’t we declare an armistice for ten minutes
to bury our dead?”</p>

<p>“I have no war with you,” she replied, with no
interest. “I simply don’t like you. Why should
we talk about it?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no trouble on that score,” said Jim,
smiling. He rather enjoyed her acerbity. “You
see, I’m not exactly fond of you. But we’re living
under the same roof and eating at the same table.
If we could agree on a truce or a pretense that we
are not distasteful to each other—merely while
we’re in the house—it might make Mrs. Stickney’s
life a bit more joyous. I assure you that if I had
known you lived here I shouldn’t have intruded.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stickney has a right to take whatever
boarders she chooses.”</p>

<p>“I’m not asking you to be friends—” Jim
stopped. He was conscious of that feeling of sudden
determination, of that urge to quick action which
had come upon him several times since his arrival
in Diversity, of that spirit which had earned for
him among his workmen the name of Sudden Jim.
So he cut off his sentence and started another.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be your friend, whether you like it
or not. Possibly I shall even like you. You seem
to need friends, if what you said to me the other day
is an indication of what is really going on inside you.
The matter is out of your hands. You said absurd
things; things dangerous for any young woman to
say, even if she knows in her heart they’re ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“They were not absurd. I meant them. You
had no business to be there to hear—to know. You
let me talk when I was unstrung. You spied—it
amounted to that.”</p>

<p>“Let it stand that way. I do know and I’m going
to meddle. You hate Diversity because it isn’t
New York City. You talk recklessly to a stranger.
The sum of the matter is that you are steering for a
big unpleasantness. If you don’t like things as they
are, what is the sense of putting in your time making
them worse? Pretty soon you’ll talk and think and
gloom yourself into doing something that’ll smash
the china. So I’m going to meddle. Of course I
don’t know you, and I haven’t any personal interest
in you. But I’m interested in you as a sociological
specimen. As such I’m going to be polite to you,
and as entertaining as possible while we’re at Mrs.
Stickney’s table. I shall expect you to be humanly
polite to me. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>She looked at him queerly, almost apprehensively.
When she replied her voice was low, not cold, not
friendly. Jim’s will had encountered her will and
been the stronger.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’ll be reasonably decent—so Mrs. Stickney
won’t lose her appetite?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In the house. But nowhere else. And I
shall hate you—hate you.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough for a beginning.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you dare to watch me. Don’t dare
to pry into my affairs. Don’t dare to interfere with
me in any way.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ducharme, if you fell into the river it
would be only human for me to fish you out. Drowning
isn’t the worst thing there is. Folks who would
jump into the water after you would stand by and
let trouble come to you which would make you wish
you could drown. A man has the right to interfere.
Humanity gives it to him. It’s silly to think I have
the right to save your life from a physical danger,
but haven’t the right to save you from the other kind.
You say it’s none of my business. It is my business.
What threatens any human being is the business of
every other human being, if he weren’t too lazy or too
hidebound or too conventional to admit it. You
have brains—or you wouldn’t be in the state of
mind you are. You know logic when you meet it
face to face—and that was logic. The trouble
with you is ambition that has fermented in the
can.”</p>

<p>“You are a bumptious young man,” she said,
hotly. “You’re full of school-book theories. What
do you know about a woman? About her problems?
What do you know about anything? You haven’t
lived yet. I’m a dozen years older than you—in
knowing what the world is. You talked idealistic
nonsense the other day about the good there is in
the world; you’re talking idealistic nonsense to-day.
You’re a cub altruist. What you think is humanitarianism
is merely impertinence. Altruism is just
a word in the dictionary.”</p>

<p>“I knew you had brains,” said Jim, “and I’ll bet
you disagree with Mrs. Stickney about woman’s
sphere. She says every woman ought to be bossed
by a man—and shouldn’t be allowed the vote till
she’s a grandmother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree. A woman is an individual, complete—she
needs no man for a complement. Her
abilities are as great, her potentialities as strong,
She has the right to own herself, to guard herself, to
reach out for the life she wants as a man does.
Because her risk in life is greater she has the right to
more than equality; she has the right to special
privilege and special protection. She has the right
to demand that she be put in a condition where she
can protect her treasures, material, physical, spiritual.
And how can she do it as things are? Less
than half the world—in trousers—holds the majority
in captivity, exercising the rights of conquerors.
You make laws to bind us. Men make laws respecting
the peculiar problems of women—when
men know less of women and their problems than
they do of the mound-builders. We don’t ask to make
your laws—only men can make laws for men;
but we do demand to make our own laws. We
demand that weapons be placed in our hands
for our own defense. With some of the theories
I do not agree, but I do insist that women
should not be left—in the condition they are now—as
the women of a sacked city, at the mercy of the
conquerors.”</p>

<p>“You have thought, haven’t you? Perhaps not
altogether healthily, but keenly. Dinner-table conversations
won’t be trite.”</p>

<p>“Thought! What has there been to do in Diversity
but think? And the more I think, the more I
comprehend, the worse the handcuffs cut into my
wrists. Some day it will become unendurable.”</p>

<p>“And then,” Jim said, “I shall jump into the
water after you. We’ll take altruism out of the
dictionary for that one time, anyhow.”</p>

<p>She said nothing, moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“Our agreement is sealed?” he asked. “We are
to act toward each other like ordinarily polite human
beings while we are in the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Are we to shake hands on it?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, sharply, and went out, carrying
herself lightly, with splendid poise, eye-delighting
grace.</p>

<p>Jim felt a tinge of regret that her face was not
lovely. With the intellect that was hers, he thought
gravely, with her beauty of line and motion, beauty
of face would have made her a miracle. But she
was no miracle. She was a small, over-burdened,
vainly protesting girl who had fought her way alone
to such ideals as she possessed. With her will she
thought she had molded her own soul. She did not
know that souls are never subject to finite processes;
she did not know that each soul is a single drop
from the great ocean of Divinity, coming to us in
such purity as the great ocean possesses, to be made
more pure or to be defiled by our acts—but never to
be altered by our wills. One day would come when
she would call up her soul before her and know it as
she did not know it now.</p>

<p>Jim’s final thought on the matter was that Marie
was not a modern woman, not an advanced woman,
but a primitive woman, an atavism, fighting as her
remotest mother must have fought for the very right
to be.</p>

<h1 id='t2554'>CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<p>The mills started as well as any new mills could be
expected to start. They did not run perfectly;
minor defects developed, machines ran stiffly, hot-boxes
developed, belts required tightening; but Jim
Ashe was willing to praise his millwrights for good
work done. As he walked through the big plant
between rows of machines which chugged or punched
or sawed rhythmically; as he watched hardwood logs
crawl up the slide at the rear of the mill, and pass
through a multitude of processes to emerge into the
warehouse finished clothespins or dishes or bowls,
he felt a sense of pride in the thing he was doing. He
was drawing straight from Nature to minister to the
necessities of man. It was no ignoble task.</p>

<p>If profits came to him, they would be honestly
earned profits, the results of labor. He was not
wasting as timber had been wasted before his day.
Every scrap of wood that came into his mill was
utilized. Modern machinery made possible a saving
in timber that thirty years ago would have run into
hundreds of millions of feet of pine, had the pioneer
wasters availed themselves of it. Thin band-saws
turned a minimum of each log into ashes; with
them Jim got seven boards where old-time circular
saws had been able to give but six. Resaws redeemed
the slabs, took from them the finest gold of
the timber which lay just under the bark. In other
days slab-piles had been known to burn constantly
for years, a savage waste. Sawdust, remnants of
slabs, edgings furnished the fuel which gave him his
power. Here was nothing of which to be ashamed;
much to justify pride. Here was an enterprise a
man might defend before the court of posterity.</p>

<p>But if the mills ran to Jim’s satisfaction at first
they did not improve as he demanded. In ten days
from the beginning there swept over the plant a
pestilence of mishaps, each mishap causing the shutdown
of a department, sometimes of the whole mill.
It did not abate, but continued maddeningly. The
shrill toot of the little whistle which commanded the
engineer to stop motion became a throb in a sore
tooth to Jim. Each accident was small; the total
of them reached dangerous magnitude.</p>

<p>Jim called in Nelson, head millwright, and his
superintendent, John Beam. They came wearing
the faces of harried men.</p>

<p>“In three days,” Jim said, shortly, “we’ve lost
five hours in shut-downs. Why?”</p>

<p>“Every night,” said Nelson, “we inspect every
belt, every pulley, every gear, every machine. We
make sure nothing is wrong—and next day a dozen
things go wrong.</p>

<p>“The last shut-down was for a split pulley on the
main shaft. I went over that shaft last night myself.
That pulley was as tight and sound as any pulley
could be. And it twisted off this morning. We
had to shut down yesterday to fix the main driving-belt.
Four rivets had come loose and she’d have
pulled clean apart. There wasn’t a sign of a loose
rivet night before last—I’d take my oath on it.”
He looked gloomily out of the window. The thing
was twanging on his nerves as well as on Jim’s.</p>

<p>“John and I aren’t trying to make excuses for
ourselves. We’d be tickled to death to take the
blame if we could only fix it on to ourselves. What
makes me want to roll over and howl is that we can’t
fix it any place. In spite of all we can do these
things happen. It’s just as he says about what he’s
seen. Things I know were sound and in perfect
runnin’ condition at night goes wrong in the mornin’.
And how in blazes are we goin’ to explain the nails?”</p>

<p>“What nails?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“In the logs. Every sawyer expects to find some
nails when he’s sawin’ maple. Especially in a sugar
country. They was drove in to hold sap buckets.
But a man don’t expect to find ’em in beech and
birch—and he don’t expect to find brand-new
ten-penny nails, neither. The saw-filer’s tearin’ his hair.
If it keeps on we won’t have a saw to cut with in
the big mill. You know what a nail’ll do to a saw,
Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the sawyer keep his eyes open for
them?” Jim snapped.</p>

<p>“Keep his eyes open! Mr. Ashe, before he puts
a log on the carriage now he goes over it from end
to end. You can’t see a nail that’s countersunk
so the head’s half an inch in.”</p>

<p>“The way you say that sounds as if you meant
something. Out with it.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Nelson, doggedly, “that it looks
to me as if somebody was plantin’ them nails so’s
we’d saw into ’em. I mean it looks to me like
somebody sneaked in here and tampered with
things after we get through inspectin’. I mean that
the things that’s happened in this mill couldn’t ’a’
happened without bein’ helped to happen.”
John Beam nodded his head in agreement.</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” Jim said, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is. Maybe a crazy man’s doin’ it.
But, Mr. Ashe, it’s bein’ done. I know it as well
as if I’d seen the feller doin’ it.”</p>

<p>“How about the watchmen?”</p>

<p>“All of ’em worked for us in the old mills. ’Tain’t
none of them. I’d take my Bible oath on that.”</p>

<p>Jim sat silent a moment, scowling at the floor.</p>

<p>“You men know what shut-downs mean,” he said.
“Here’s five hours in three days—half a day’s time
gone. That means a loss in wages alone of a hundred
dollars, which is a small part of it. It’s got to
stop. I don’t care whether these accidents are accidents
or whether somebody is arranging them-they’ve
got to quit, and quit sudden. Suppose we
lose a hundred dollars every three days. That’s
two hundred a week and ten thousand a year. Have
you talked about this to anybody?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>Beam shook his head,</p>

<p>“Is there any talk in the mill?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard any.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep quiet about it. If you fellows are
right, we don’t want to advertise it. Now clear
out of here and do the best you can. Keep your
eyes open. Don’t get suspicious of anybody till
you have mighty good reason. I’d hate to think
it was any of the crew.”</p>

<p>“It’s somebody that knows the run of things.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What possible reason could anybody have, Mr.
Ashe—”</p>

<p>“That’ll be my job—to find out. This suspicion
of yours is upsetting. I want to think about it.
Then I’ll do something.”</p>

<p>Nelson’s eyes twinkled as he glanced sideways at
Beam. As they went out Jim heard him say in a
low tone:</p>

<p>“You bet he’ll do somethin’—and it’ll come sudden
and astonishin’. Sudden Jim!” There was a note of
affection in Nelson’s voice as he pronounced the name.</p>

<p>Jim settled down to think about it. That some
one was planning deliberately to cripple the plant
by injuring its machinery was illogical. It affronted
Jim’s reason. Yet it was a theory impossible to
dismiss. It must be considered. In that case, who
had an adequate motive? Nobody, so far as Jim
could see at first glance.</p>

<p>He set up the possibilities, only to knock them
down one by one. It might be the work of a man
with a mania for malicious destruction. Highly
improbable, thought Jim. It might be workmen
or a workman with a grievance practising sabotage.
But so far as Jim knew there was no discontent;
the crew were satisfied; there had been no complaints,
no unrest. That possibility must be dismissed.
It might be some individual in Diversity
with a grudge to work off against the company.
But Jim had never heard of conflict between the
company and a citizen, nor had unfriendliness developed
since his arrival. This, too, was dismissed.</p>

<p>Who had an interest in the failure of the concern?
A thought which lay deep in his mind, which he
had hoped to conceal even from himself, obtruded:
the Clothespin Club. As an organization of men
who had fought upward through adverse conditions,
against obstacles, side by side with his father, Jim
did not believe them guilty. But organizations of
honorable business men often employ underlings,
concerning whose methods their masters neglect
to make close inquiry. Might this not be the case?
It was the sole possibility to stand erect before
Jim’s reason.</p>

<p>The Club brought up speculations on Morton J.
Welliver—which led to Michael Moran and Zaanan
Frame. They led to the Diversity Hardwood Company,
of which Moran was now the head. Should the
Ashe Clothespin Company fail, who was most likely
to succeed it? Who would be in the best position
to take over the wreck and operate it? To that
question there was but one answer—the Diversity
Hardwood Company. Now Jim became obsessed
by a real suspicion—and he would act upon it until
evidence showed him he was at fault. He would
move on the theory that Welliver, Moran, and
Frame were not clean of hand. Frame! What had
he to base a suspicion of Zaanan Frame upon?
Nothing but an evident acquaintance with Welliver,
a patent closeness of relations to Moran. No, the
old justice’s name must stand among the suspected.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Ashe?” roared an angry voice in the
outer office.</p>

<p>Jim heard Grierson’s parchment voice give the
direction, and heavy feet pounded down the hall to
his door. Watson, foreman of the veneer room, burst
in, a huge veneer knife in his arms—no mean weight.
“Look at that,” he said, belligerently, dropping the
knife on Jim’s desk with a bang. “Look at that!
Two knives this mornin’.”</p>

<p>There was plain to view a generous nick on the
cutting edge.</p>

<p>“What did it?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“Nail. Twice this mornin’. Now I’ve got to
shut down one lathe till the other knife’s ground
down. What land of timber is this, anyhow, with
nails hid all over it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter with your eyesight, is there?”</p>

<p>Watson glared at Jim, shook a grimy finger at him.</p>

<p>“I kin see nails as far as anybody, but I can’t
look through an inch of timber to ’em. We always
look out for nails, but it’s easy to see ’em. Bolts
come to us from the vats with the bark peeled, and
mostly the peelers get the nails with their spuds.
But nobody kin see a nail that’s sunk an inch and
the hole plugged. Yes, sir, that’s what I mean.
The hole was plugged!”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Strip of veneer showed it. Slice of plug was
still stickin’ in. And we went over a dozen more
bolts with a fine-tooth comb. We found one with
a spot in it that looked suspicious. Dug it out and
it was a plug! And we notched in and hit the nail.
Now what does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means you’re to keep your mouth shut about
it, and tell some kind of a story to your gang to
keep their mouths shut.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s goin’ to get hurt,” Watson said,
darkly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim, slowly, “somebody is going to
get hurt—bad.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’ll have to look over every bolt with
opery-glasses,” growled Watson.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a man who is to do nothing else.
Tell Beam I said so.”</p>

<p>Jim put on his coat and hat and went to dinner.
His physical machine was such that it required nourishment,
no matter what was happening to the mental
department. Some men lose their appetites
when things go wrong. Not so Jim Ashe. Some
men drown their troubles in drink. Jim had his
drowned three times daily in hunger.</p>

<p>When he had eaten his dinner—for the Widow
Stickney had only vaguely heard of a strange custom
of moving that meal along till six o’clock and having
a thing at noon called luncheon; to her, luncheon
was something you put up in a basket and took to
a picnic—he leaned back in his chair for his usual
midday chat with the old lady.</p>

<p>“You’ve lived here long, Mrs. Stickney?”</p>

<p>“Born in the county.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be pretty well acquainted with
folks hereabout.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to live here long to be that. Everybody
you meet is boilin’ over with anxiety to give
you the true life history of everybody else. You
kin git to know Diversity consid’able well in a week,
if you’re willin’ to listen.”</p>

<p>“Justice Frame’s lived here a long time, too,
hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Him and me was children together.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stickney, I’m not asking this wholly out of
curiosity. I’m new to you all. I’ve got my hands
pretty full, and there are people in the world who
would be glad to see me spill part of my load. It’s a
fine thing to know whom you can depend on and
whom you want to shy at. So I’m asking you to
tell me something about Zaanan Frame.”</p>

<p>“He’s a stiff-spined old grampus,” said the widow,
promptly. “Him and me squabbles so’s the neighbors
’most come a-runnin’ in to part us. He’s powerful
set on havin’ his own way—and mostly he gits
it. He’s sharper ’n a new sickle. He’s been justice
of the peace here since before Mary Whittaker was
born, and Mary’s got a boy of ten herself. Hain’t
never been nothin’ more ’n just justice of the peace,
but he runs the whole blessed county out of his
office. He’s one of them things the papers call a
political boss; but if I do say it, Zaanan Frame does
a good job of it. But he runs it so folks git the
wuth of their taxes, and so that them that wants
justice gits it.</p>

<p>“About dependin’ on him,” she went on, after
drawing a breath, “you won’t never find him
dodgin’ about underhand. If he likes you, he hain’t
apt to show it by runnin’ up and kissin’ you in public;
and if he don’t like you, he don’t cuss you and
try to hit you with a pebble whenever you meet—but
you soon git to know. I’ve knowed him to give
a man he didn’t like all the best of a deal—so
nobody’d accuse him of workin’ a personal spite.
I’ve knowed him to refuse things to a friend he’d
’a’ done for a stranger. They say he stretches the
powers of his office and does things a justice hain’t
got no right to do—and I calc’late he does. But
it’s in time of need for somebody. He meddles into
folkses’ fam’ly affairs, and plans to marry off this
girl to that feller—which plans mostly works out to
his notion.</p>

<p>“He’s got a sort of notion he was put here by God
Almighty to be father and mother to every man,
woman, and child in the county. But there hain’t
no complaints of him as a parent, though he’s a
mean-dispositioned, meddlin’, sharp-tongued, stubborn-minded
old coot.</p>

<p>“Diversity hain’t given much to sayin’ anythin’
but meannesses about folks; we don’t speak none
about Zaanan, but I calc’late there’s growed men
that’ll walk behind him to the cemetery with tears
a-runnin’ down their cheeks, and wimmin that’ll
be sobbin’ and leetle children that’ll know what it
means to lose their pa. If there’s any argument
when Zaanan gits to stand before the great white
throne, he’s got a right to say: ‘Wait a minnit, Lord,
till we kin git in a number of souls that’s here but
was bound for the other place till I got my hands on
the reins.’ If you’re worryin’ as to where Zaanan
Frame stands, I kin tell you—he stands where it’s
honestest and lightest for him to stand. My goodness! but
hain’t I been goin’ on about him! Thinkin’
as high of him as I do, it’s a wonder I don’t up and
make him my third.”</p>

<p>Jim sat gnawing his finger silently for many
minutes after the widow was done speaking. She
spoke as one who knew. Jim knew she would have
testified in a court of law just as she had spoken to
him. Nor would she have spoken so except from
certainty. He was compelled, therefore, to revise
his judgments and suspicions.</p>

<p>“If you were in a hard place, Mrs. Stickney, and
needed advice, would you go to Zaanan Frame?”</p>

<p>“I’d hitch up and go at a gallop,” she said.</p>

<p>“That,” said Jim, “is about what I think I’ll do.”</p>

<h1 id='t2952'>CHAPTER IX</h1>

<p>Jim rapped on the door of Zaanan Frame’s
office. At the last minute he had been of two
minds whether he should go in or pass on about his
business. The sound of his own knuckles on the
panel decided him.</p>

<p>“Come in,” called Zaanan’s voice.</p>

<p>Jim entered and saw the old justice sitting behind
his desk, a sheep-bound volume propped up before
him. Over the top of this a pair of sharp blue eyes
shaded by bushy eyebrows, each of which would have
gladdened the heart of an ambitious young roan
could he have had it for a mustache, peered at Jim.</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Zaanan.</p>

<p>“You’ve made it pretty evident,” Jim said, stiffly,
“that you don’t like me. I can’t say I have felt
any uncontrollable affection for you—”</p>

<p>“Whoa there!” said Zaanan, closing his book,
Tiffany’s <span class='it'>Justices’ Guide</span>, which he maintained to
be the greatest contribution to human knowledge,
especially of the law, since Moses received the
tablets of stone. “Young feller, if you hain’t too
young to learn, lemme tell you it’s possible to ketch
more flies with maple sugar than you kin with stummick
bitters. Jest smooth down the hair along your
back and don’t go walkin’ round me stiff-legged like
a dog lookin’ for a fight.” Zaanan’s eyes twinkled.
“Now, then, set and onbosom yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve come to see you, Judge, because I have been
assured that friend or enemy can trust you—”</p>

<p>“The Widder Stickney’s been flappin’ her wings
and cacklin’,” observed Zaanan. “Um! I figgered
you’d be to see me—or else you wouldn’t. Gittin’
ready to kick out, but you need a wall to lean
against, eh?”</p>

<p>“Kick out? What makes you think I’m getting
ready to kick out? And at whom?”</p>

<p>“‘Whom,’” quoted Zaanan. “I’ve heard of that
there word. It’s grammar, hain’t it, but I dun’no’s
I ever expected to hear it spoke in Diversity. How’s
the meals to the widder’s?”</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed,” said Jim, nonplussed.</p>

<p>“You hain’t the only boarder, I hear tell.”</p>

<p>“No; Miss Ducharme is there, too.”</p>

<p>“I want to know,” said Zaanan, his eyes twinkling
again. “Makes it pleasanter, I calc’late—you two
young folks together.”</p>

<p>“I think Miss Ducharme could bear up under the
blow if I were to board some place else.”</p>

<p>“Um!” said Zaanan. “Mill hain’t runnin’ very
good, I hear.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I came to see you about—that and
other things.”</p>

<p>“Good mill, hain’t it? New machines? Ought
to run, hadn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It ought to and it’s going to. But, Judge, it
looks a lot as if somebody didn’t want it to.”</p>

<p>“Um! That might mean consid’able and it might
mean nothin’. Accordin’ to my notion one of the
easiest ways of givin’ information is to think up
words that mean what you want to tell and then to
say ’em. Beatin’ round the bush may scare up a
rabbit, but you hain’t huntin’ rabbits. Eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, somebody has been tampering with
our machinery to make it break down. Somebody
has been driving nails into our logs to dull our
saws. Whoever it is has made us shut down five
hours in the last three days.”</p>

<p>“You figger somebody’s doin’ it deliberate?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Got any proof?”</p>

<p>Jim laid before the old man such evidence as he
had, but it was sufficient. Zaanan wagged his head.</p>

<p>“Calc’late there hain’t no doubt of it. Suspect
anybody special?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any suspicion who is working the mischief,
but I have an idea he isn’t doing it for himself.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s hirin’ him to do it, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who might it be?”</p>

<p>“There are only two interests who would have
any motive in breaking me. One is the organization
of clothespin manufacturers. I’m in a fight with
them now because they wanted to run my business.
The other is the Diversity Hardwood Company.”</p>

<p>“Hum! I figgered from what Welliver said a spell
back that he wasn’t tickled to death with you and
your doin’s. You hain’t a bit afraid who you’re
suspicious of, be you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be suspicious of everybody—and I’m
going to be till I know who can be trusted.”</p>

<p>“Kind of suspected me a mite, eh? Figgered I
was tarred with the Welliver and Moran stick?”</p>

<p>“I got to thinking pretty hard when I saw you
with them the morning after my row with Welliver.
You seemed to be pretty good friends.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late we be. Knowed ’em a long time.”</p>

<p>“Judge, you don’t need any more to show you
I’ve a bad situation to deal with. I came to you—I
don’t just know why I came to you. On impulse,
I expect.”</p>

<p>“Sudden Jim,” said Zaanan, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You was sayin’ you come to me on impulse.
Must ’a’ figgered I’d be some use to you. Nobody’d
climb a greased pole if ’twa’n’t for the five-dollar
bill tacked on top of it. Was you wantin’ advice or
money or the loan of my shot-gun?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Jim, slowly, “that what brought
me here was a vague sort of hope of finding a friend.
When a fellow’s up against a fight he feels lonesome.
He likes to know there’s somebody besides himself to
depend on. I had no reason to expect it—quite the
contrary, perhaps. Anyhow, I believe you could
help me with this particular problem if you wanted
to.”</p>

<p>“Young feller, a justice of the peace has a heap of
duties, some set down in the statutes and some that
just come nat’ral. I’ve been justice more ’n thirty
year, and I calc’late them duties that no legislature
ever thought up is the most important. F’r instance,
I married Kitty Fox and Pliny Hearter. That was
consid’able of a transaction; but it was consid’able
more of one to git ’em back to lovin’ and trustin’
after they’d started runnin’ round for a lawyer to
git ’em a divorce. The law don’t give me the right
to do quite a stretch of the meddlin’ I do; but it sort
of appertains to this here office, and I do it. You
don’t want nothin’ of me that’s printed in law-books.
So far’s bein’ your friend—why, I hain’t makin’ no
sich agreements. Friends hain’t made by writin’
out contracts to that effect. I hain’t seen enough
of you to git to yearnin’ over you. But I’ll ease your
mind some on one p’int—I hain’t actively concerned
to do you no harm. Also, I hain’t got no prejudices
ag’in you.”</p>

<p>Jim shrugged his shoulders. “It was a ridiculous
sort of notion for me to come like this, without any
idea what I wanted. I need help, but what kind of
help I don’t know. Anyhow, I’m glad you’re not
with the enemy, whoever they are.”</p>

<p>“You mentioned names—on suspicion. One of
the onhealthiest habits a man ever got into. I’ve
knowed folks to die of it. You’ve figgered out for
yourself who’s after your pelt, and why. But you
hain’t got no more proof than ol’ man Simpkins
had when he wanted me to git leetle Georgie Reed
up before me for stealin’ melons. The ol’ man missed
a big melon—next day Georgie was bein’ doctored
for stummick-ache. ’Twa’n’t out of reason. It was
evidence I was willin’ to weigh and pass on in private.
I calc’late Georgie et that melon. But as a court
of law I couldn’t do nothin’ but declare Simpkins
’u’d have to show plainer proofs. That’s your fix.
But, young feller, if I was you I calc’late I’d kinder
keep my specs wiped clean and I wouldn’t let my
hair grow down over my ears to speak of. G’-by.”</p>

<p>Jim was astonished. Never had he been thus
bruskly dismissed. He strode out of the office; but
a sense of humor came to his rescue. He turned and
bade the old justice good afternoon. Zaanan did
not appear to hear.</p>

<p>Zaanan turned the pages of Tiffany’s <span class='it'>Justices’
Guide</span> for fifteen minutes after Jim’s departure.
Then he raised his voice in a call for Dolf Springer.
Dolf, it happened, was whittling on Zaanan’s doorstep.
It was his custom to do so during Zaanan’s
office hours, for Dolf desired greatly to be useful
to the dictator of Diversity County’s politics. Dolf’s
ambition carried him so high as to make him covet
the office of pathmaster. Therefore he lay in wait
for opportunities to serve Zaanan.</p>

<p>“Perty busy, Dolf?” Zaanan asked. “Time all
took up to-day?”</p>

<p>“Got a while to spare, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Think of takin’ a drive, Dolf? Eh? Was that
what you was plannin’ on?”</p>

<p>“I was goin’ out for a spell.”</p>

<p>“Um! What direction, Dolf? Didn’t happen to
be goin’ out the River Road, did you?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly where I was goin’. Had a errant
out that way.”</p>

<p>“Take you far, Dolf? So far you couldn’t git back
to-night?”</p>

<p>“It might, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Wa’n’t goin’ far’s Gilder’s, was you—up back
of the Company’s Camp Three?”</p>

<p>“Goin’ a leetle past there, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Um! Know Gilders?”</p>

<p>“Calc’late to.”</p>

<p>“If you was to see him, Dolf, d’ you figger on
stoppin’ for a chat? And if you do, what be you
goin’ to talk about?”</p>

<p>“I’d mention I hadn’t seen him for a long spell.”</p>

<p>“To be sure.”</p>

<p>“And I’d mention I seen you to-day.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. S’pose it would occur to you to say
somethin’ to the effect that it looked like business
was pickin’ up and stirrin’ times was comin’? Eh?
And that fellers with an ax to grind had better git
out the grindstone? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I guess I’d make some sich
observation.”</p>

<p>“And would you kind of speak about the new
clothespin-mill? And allude to how the whistle’s
always tootin’ for it to shut down on account of
somethin’ bustin’?”</p>

<p>“It ’u’d be int’restin’ news to Gilders.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be any more ’n nat’ral for you to
wonder what was the cause of it? Eh? Might
suggest that somebody up his way could explain
it. ’Twouldn’t be s’rprisin’, would it?”</p>

<p>“Likely to be so,” said Dolf.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Dolf,” said Zaanan.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Judge,” said Dolf.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Dolf was driving a livery rig
out the River Road. A twelve-mile ride lay before
him, and he did not lag. Some hours later he
stopped, tied his horse to a tree by the roadside and
plunged into the woods—jack-pine, scrub-oak, underbrush.
Fifteen minutes’ scrambling brought him
to an insignificant clearing with a log shanty in the
middle of it. He stopped cautiously and looked about.
Then he called: “Steve! Hey, Steve Gilders!”</p>

<p>A man, perhaps forty-five years old, stood by the
shanty door. A moment before the space had been
empty. He did not seem to come to that spot
from anywhere, but simply to be there all at once.
He was what our grandmothers would have called a
“fine figger” of a man. Upward of six feet two
inches he was, and handsome of feature. The handsomeness
was marred by a somberness, a sternness
of demeanor.</p>

<p>The admiration he excited was chilled by the rifle
he carried under his arm—and the manner in which
he carried it. It explained why Dolf had taken
the precaution to call before he ventured near.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” inquired Gilders.</p>

<p>“Zaanan Frame sent me.”</p>

<p>The man’s face relaxed. “Then you’re welcome.
Come in.”</p>

<p>Dolf followed him. “Zaanan sent a message, but
I can’t make head or tail to it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Probably ’twa’n’t intended you should,” said
Gilders.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” Dolf said, “Zaanan he told me to come
a-drivin’ out here and say to you that fellers with a
ax to grind had better git their grindstone out; and
that business was pickin’ up and stirrin’ times was
ahead; and that the new clothespin-mill was havin’
trouble with its machinery and somebody up this
here way might be able to explain what was the
matter. Don’t seem like much of a message to drive
twelve miles to deliver.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Goin’ right back?”</p>

<p>“Zaanan acted like he wanted me to stay till
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Git your hoss then. You kin sleep here.”</p>

<p>Dolf went obediently after his animal. Steve
Gilders shut his eyes and smiled. It was a peculiar
thing to see. Somehow it was not reassuring, but
exceedingly sinister. He had read Zaanan’s message
correctly. He knew what to do.</p>

<p>When Dolf came back Gilders was gone, nor did
Dolf see his host again that night. But that worried
Dolf very little. Indeed, it must be said he slept
more comfortably for Gilders’s absence.</p>

<p>At sunrise Gilders appeared out of the woods,
strode lithely into the shanty, laboriously wrote a
letter to Zaanan—which he sealed carefully—and
delivered it to Dolf.</p>

<p>“I calc’late you’d better make tracks for town,”
he said.</p>

<p>Dolf did not argue the matter.</p>

<h1 id='t3314'>CHAPTER X</h1>

<p>When Jim Ashe returned to the mill after his
conversation with Zaanan Frame he found the
machinery idle, employees pouring out of the entrances.
He walked past them and into the building
in a frame of mind that would have rendered him
undesirable as a dinner companion. Another breakdown!</p>

<p>He found Nelson and Beam standing below a
couple of mechanics who were working over a pair
of big gears. They only nodded curtly at his approach,
for apparently their patience, like Jim’s, was
close to the fusing-point.</p>

<p>“Now what?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“Core gear. Stripped the wooden teeth out of it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>Nelson shrugged his shoulders, but Beam replied.
“Just got started after dinner,” he said. “I was
standin’ not ten feet from here when I seen that
solid gear lift up into the air, it looked like two foot,
and come down smash onto the wooden teeth.
Twouldn’t be so bad if we had a spare set of teeth,
but we hain’t.”</p>

<p>“Got to cut ’em out,” supplemented Nelson.</p>

<p>“How long does that mean?”</p>

<p>“If we work all night we ought to get to runnin’
by noon to-morrow—with luck.”</p>

<p>“Who’s to blame?” Jim demanded</p>

<p>“Who drove the nails in the logs?” John Beam
replied, a trifle sullenly. “Nelson went over those
gears last night. I seen him. He says there wa’n’t
anythin’ wrong then.”</p>

<p>Jim set his teeth; the urge to action came over
him that had earned him the name of Sudden Jim.
He recognized it, expected himself to do something
decisive—and was surprised that he did not. Instead
he found himself reflecting coolly, choosing the
better from the worse course of action.</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped now, boys,” he said. “Speed
up and get her going again—and keep quiet about
it.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and went up to the office,
where he found the noon mail on his desk. The
first letter he opened was the resignation of his salesman
for New York and New England, a man of
exceptional ability, whose sales mounted to many
car-loads a year, and whose customers were his customers,
not those of the Ashe Clothespin Company.
Winkleman could take them with him to whatever
firm he had sold his services. Jim knew well
Winkleman had not abandoned the woodenware
trade—he had gone over to Welliver or some other
of the enemy. Here, Jim recognized, was the
shrewdest blow of the war.</p>

<p>Jim went on opening his mail. Another letter
was from Silvers, his Chicago representative. This
man handled the product of Jim’s mills as a part of
his brokerage business. He was able; no week
passed that did not see at least one car-load consigned
to him or to his customers.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>What’s up? (the letter said). Welliver wants me to drop you
and come over to him. Says your goose is cooked and offers
me an extra two and a half per cent. commission. Says you
started this clothespin rumpus. Had a contract ready for me
to sign, and wanted me to drop you unsight and unseen, I
wouldn’t do it, but his offer is tempting.</p>

</div>

<p>There was more to the communication, but here
we have the heart of it. One blow followed another.
The attack had commenced in earnest and Jim was
on the defensive. He had declared war, but had not
struck a blow. Now he must act swiftly, intelligently,
efficiently. First he wired Silvers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Won’t meet Welliver’s offer. We’re sound. If you can’t
stick by us in fight don’t want you anyhow. Want men can
depend on. Wire answer.</p>

</div>

<p>Next he called in Grierson.</p>

<p>“What percentage of our business is in New York
and New England?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A quarter, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Who sells heaviest there?”</p>

<p>“Plum and Mannikin.”</p>

<p>“One of them has hired away Winkleman.”</p>

<p>Grierson made a crisp, crackling sound with his
lips. It indicated dismay. Jim smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“We’re going to increase our Eastern business,”
he said. “We haven’t pushed it as we might, just
as those Eastern factories haven’t pushed for orders
in the West. But we’re going to. We’re going after
all we can get anywhere we can get it. It’s three
o’clock. I want you to catch the six-o’clock train
for Buffalo. Then New York and Boston. Go and
pack. By the time you’re back here I’ll have your
instructions ready for you.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Ashe—”</p>

<p>“Hustle,” said Jim. It was Sudden Jim speaking
now.</p>

<p>In an hour Grierson was back, dubious, flustered.</p>

<p>“Grierson,” said Jim, “you know the personnel
of the woodenware business better than I. Here’s
what I want you to do: Land the best woodenware
broker in Buffalo to handle our line for the city and
western New York. Get him! Give him seven and
a half commission, if necessary. Have him sign a
contract like Levine’s in Cleveland. Then hit for
New York. There’ll be soreness somewhere over
this Winkleman business. It must have cut into
somebody’s territory. You know who to go to.
We want the biggest—somebody with a sales organization.
Offer them all New York and all New
England outside of Boston. If they hang out for
Boston, give it to them, too. If they don’t insist on
it go to Boston and repeat the dose. I want somebody
who will sell our goods—and keep us hustling
to fill orders. We’ll put a dent in Plum and Mannikin.
Now you’ll want to bury your young man in
directions for his guidance while you’re gone. Get
at it. And don’t come back here unless you’ve got
what I want.”</p>

<p>Grierson was blinking. “Your father was a swift
mover when he was r’iled,” said he; “but for
suddenness, and for landing a hard punch, I guess
you are a little ahead of him. I’ll do my best,
Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>Jim’s next move was a wire to Philadelphia.
Pennsylvania was the home ground of the Jenkins
mills, and Jim was determined to hit as many heads
as he could. Any woodenware man worthy of the
name was familiar with the house of Sands &amp; Stein,
of the Quaker City. Jim’s wire said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>If interested handing our whole line Pennsylvania
exclusive territory wire.</p>

</div>

<p>These things accomplished, Jim entered upon the
routine of his work, which occupied him until six
o’clock was near. Just as he was leaving the office
a telegram arrived from Silvers.</p>

<p>“I’m no quitter,” it said, tersely, and Jim knew
that he had found at least one dependable man.</p>

<p>As Jim approached he saw a man seated on the
Widow Stickney’s porch. He wondered if the widow
was entering on a campaign to conquer her “third,”
and had invited him to supper as an opening gun.
Jim was not familiar enough with Diversity’s citizens
yet to identify an individual by his legs, and
this one’s face was concealed by the climbing vine.
If Jim had been a native of the village he would have
experienced no such difficulty, for Diversity’s male
inhabitants were as easy to distinguish by their
pants as by their faces. We recognize a man by his
face because that is the face he has always worn.
The same rule held true of Diversity’s trousers.
Old Clem Beagle still went to church in the garments
that covered him when he was married sixty years
before.</p>

<p>When Jim climbed the porch he was convinced
that the widow had nothing whatever to do with the
visitor. It was Michael Moran, and Jim wondered
just who in that house was responsible for his
presence.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Ashe?” said Moran, rising
and extending his hand. “I just learned you were
boarding here. Glad to hear it. Makes it more
interesting for Miss Ducharme, I imagine, and she
needs cheering up considerable.”</p>

<p>Jim responded to the greeting, experiencing at the
same time a dubiety as to Moran’s sincerity. Indeed,
without any adequate reason for his belief he
was of the opinion that Moran was not pleased with
his presence.</p>

<p>“Sort of protegee of mine—Miss Ducharme.
Father was walking boss for me. I always take supper
with her when I’m in town, if I can manage it,”
Moran explained.</p>

<p>Jim nodded. He was remembering that it was on
the morning following a visit of Michael Moran’s
to Diversity he had first encountered Marie, on the
top of a knoll from which a view might be had of far
countries. Her reckless mood, reckless words, were
fresh in his mind, and he would have been glad to
know if Moran had anything to do with the matter.</p>

<p>“Everything starting off well at the mill?”</p>

<p>“Very well, indeed,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve started shipments. Hope you’ve
been getting cars as you wanted them. If you ever
have any difficulty, just let me know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jim. His mind was only
casually on what Moran was saying; it was striving
to penetrate to what he was thinking. From the morning
of his first sight of the man Jim had been repelled
by him. That, of course, was to be laid to the fact
that Moran was first seen in company with Welliver.
But since then Jim had been led to suspect him as an
active enemy. Stories—gossip, perhaps—that came
to his ears led him to set Moran down as a shifty
individual, a man who looked to the right and unexpectedly
threw his brick to the left. Also he had
heard from Tim Bennett and others hints regarding
Moran’s attitude toward women. But there was
proof of nothing. Jim was fair enough to admit this.
All was hint, rumor, or deduction from flimsy bases.</p>

<p>“You know, of course, that I’ve taken over the
control of the Diversity Hardwood Company?”</p>

<p>“I had heard it.”</p>

<p>“That and my railroad will bring us in touch
considerable. Before long we ought to hit on some
sort of basis so we can work together for the benefit
of both of us. We’re in a position to help each
other in a dozen ways.”</p>

<p>“By driving nails in each other’s logs,” Jim
thought, but he smiled and agreed that co-operation
seemed advisable.</p>

<p>“Conditions in the county aren’t what they ought
to be,” said Moran after puffing briefly on his cigar.
“You and I—with the influence we can exert—ought
to be able to do a lot to remedy matters.”</p>

<p>“As how?” Jim asked, really curious to know what
Moran was approaching.</p>

<p>“You and I represent practically the whole of the
county’s business interests. We ought to have more
of a say in running things than we have. As it is now—well,
we haven’t much of anything to say. Zaanan
Frame says it all, and he’s a stiff-backed, hard-headed
old scoundrel if there ever was one. Talk
about your city political bosses! Zaanan could show
them things they won’t be finding out for another
twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Pretty strong politically, is he?”</p>

<p>“Just this strong, Mr. Ashe, that he appoints the
officers in this county. Appoints ’em. Of course
there are elections, but if Zaanan told these farmers
and what-not to vote for his horse Tiffany for
President of the United States, that horse would
come close to carrying the county unanimously.
That’s how strong he is. The circuit judge is his;
the sheriff is his; the prosecutor is his. What chance
has money in such a nest? The worst of it is, the
old man’s pretty well off and you can’t reach him.”</p>

<p>“Never can tell till you try,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“I’m in a position to tell, all right. It’s no go.
The only thing is to get rid of him. If he could be
beaten out of his own job I guess he’d be done for.
And I think I can manage it with your help.”</p>

<p>“I’m not aching to meddle with politics any.”</p>

<p>“You will be when he hands you a dose of his
medicine. Look at us. Probably a dozen little
suits in the justice court every week come before
him. What protection have we?” Moran spread
his hands in a gesture of helplessness. “Any Tom,
Dick, and Harry that wants to goes ahead and sues—and
Zaanan sees to it we get the worst of it. Anywhere
else we could appeal, but here the circuit
court belongs to Zaanan, and it spends as much of its
time playing to the gallery and coddling the poor,
downtrodden working-man at my expense as Zaanan
does.”</p>

<p>“Pretty tough,” said Jim. He told himself that
here was first-class evidence to support the Widow
Stickney’s praise of Zaanan Frame. It was being
admitted he was honest, that influence did not subvert
justice. He was a boss, perhaps, but his
virtues seemed to stamp themselves on the men his
power put in office. Theoretically a boss is bad,
Jim thought, but this case seemed to demonstrate
there might be exceptions. Suppose Zaanan were
absolute monarch of Diversity, what had made him
so and what kept him in his place? Apparently it
was the fairness, the rugged squareness, of the old
man. Apparently he possessed the love and confidence
of his people to the point that they were
willing to delegate their powers to him in the belief
that he would work better for them than they could
for themselves.</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Moran. “If we could get in a
justice of the peace we could stop all these petty
suits right there. Let a couple of dozen of these
fellows find out they were going to get beaten, and
the whole mess of them would quit. I hate to think
how much money Frame costs me a year.”</p>

<p>“Or how much he benefits the man who couldn’t
help himself without Zaanan’s court,” Jim thought.
“It means much to the poor man to know that his
court—the justice’s court—is honest; that he can
carry his wrong to it and see it righted! What’s
your idea?” he asked aloud.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get him in the caucus,” said Moran.
“Couldn’t beat him at the election. I don’t suppose
there are a dozen votes cast against him in the
whole county. But that’s quite a while off. I just
wanted to mention the matter to you and find out
how you looked at it. I’m glad you agree with me.”</p>

<p>“We can do more together than we could separately,”
Jim said, jesuitically.</p>

<p>The widow appeared in the doorway and announced
supper. Jim waved Moran to precede him,
and he walked to the table feeling more sure of his
ground than he had been an hour before. His
suspicions of Moran rested on a surer foundation—the
man was not honest. He was the sort of business
man who has brought stigma on his kind by bribery,
by conniving at injustice, by seducing officers of
justice. He was ruthless. The rights of others only
represented something to be overridden. To Jim
it seemed that the day when Michael Moran replaced
Zaanan Frame as dictator of Diversity would be a
black day indeed for the county.</p>

<p>Further, he made up his mind to win that friendship
which Zaanan Frame had denied him. In his
difficulty he felt a flood of gratitude to good fortune
that such a man as Zaanan Frame was at hand and
in power. When he took his seat at the table he was
more cheerful than he had been for many a day;
his face was lighter, his eyes brighter. The widow
noticed his changed expression and was deeply
curious to account for it. The widow was a motherly
soul. Of late she had taken to coddling and worrying
over Jim. Hers was a heart that could not be
inactive—if man’s persistent mortality discouraged
her from taking another husband, she could, at least,
secretly adopt a son.</p>

<h1 id='t3709'>CHAPTER XI</h1>

<p>“Our school opens Monday, doesn’t it, Marie?”
asked Moran.</p>

<p>She turned her black eyes on him and allowed
them to rest a moment before replying. Jim Ashe
was aware of the somber glow of them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, shortly.</p>

<p>Moran chuckled. “You’re tickled to death over
it, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>The glow of her eyes became a flame—such a flame
as might eat its way through plates of steel. Jim
Ashe would have drawn back from such a fire disconcerted;
Moran was unable to meet it with his
eyes, but he was not disconcerted. Instead, it
seemed to give him satisfaction. He chuckled again.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, jovially, “you know you can
leave it when you want to.”</p>

<p>Jim was startled; looked quickly at Marie. The
flame lay dead in her eyes; she seemed merely tired,
very tired. Moran spoke again, this time to Ashe
and the widow.</p>

<p>“I’ve offered her a place in my office back in town,”
he said. “I guess she don’t hate Diversity as bad
as she says she does, or she’d take it. But the offer
holds good, Marie. Any time. Any time.”</p>

<p>The widow ruffled her feathers.</p>

<p>“Marie’s goin’ to stay right where she is. Maybe
Diversity hain’t a suburb of heaven; maybe teachin’
school’s a long ways from strummin’ a harp in
Paradise; but Marie’s got too much sense to go
flutterin’ off like a blind owl in the sunshine, not
knowin’ what she’s like to bump her head against.”</p>

<p>Marie turned slowly on the widow.</p>

<p>“When the time comes to choose I’ll choose,” she
said, speaking, it seemed, not to the widow, but to
herself.</p>

<p>The widow looked puzzled; even Moran seemed
not to understand; but Jim understood. In the
light of his first meeting with Marie on the knoll
he comprehended the significance of her words,
the rashness, the worldly wisdom of them. Hers
would be no blindfold journey. If she spread her
wings for flight it would be with eyes wide and seeing;
it would be on a calculated course, and the cost
would be itemized. He saw that she read Moran
better than he had done, and in the light of her
knowledge the page of Moran’s soul became more
legible to him. Before Moran had been an adversary--no
chivalric adversary; now he felt a cold hatred
for the man, a personal, throbbing hatred coupled
with a stinging, physical aversion. From that moment
Moran became a snake to be scotched.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot less choosin’ in this world than folks
think there is,” said the widow. “Folks spends a
heap of time separatin’ in their minds what they’re
goin’ to do from what they hain’t—gen’ally choosin’
the pleasant and throwin’ out the disagreeable.
But when they git along toward the end of things
and look back at the figgerin’ they done, they mostly
find that the good they chose wasn’t the good they
got, and the bad they chose not to have was the very
thing that pestered them. Most folks meets up
with about so much good and bad, about so much
joy and so much trouble; but the joys hain’t the
ones they looked forward to and the troubles hain’t
the ones they feared.”</p>

<p>Moran smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t agree with you, Mrs. Stickney. We get
what we plan for. Set your mind on a thing and
then plan and wait and work toward it every chance
you get. Don’t give it up. Keep your mind on it.
Don’t let a chance slip to move nearer to it. What
I want—if I want it bad enough—that thing I get.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Marie spoke—to Jim.</p>

<p>“What’s your opinion, Mr. Ashe?” she said.</p>

<p>“I? As old Sir Roger de Coverley said, ‘There’s
much to be said on both sides.’” Jim had no desire
to be drawn into argument with Moran.</p>

<p>Her lip curled. “We used to have a Congressman
here who was called Mid-channel Charlie because
his attitude toward every question was like yours
now. He was never Congressman but once.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Jim, perceiving that for some
reason she really desired his opinion, “I believe that
if you don’t choose and work to get the thing you
have chosen, you miss one of life’s finest games. I do
agree with Mrs. Stickney that if you drift along and
take what comes the chances are that good and ill
will run a fairly even race. I agree with Mr. Moran
that the man who visualizes his desire and sets it up
before him as a lighthouse—and then rows his boat
to it with all the strength of his oars—stands at least a
moderate chance of getting there. But for me, I do
not believe a man should be too set on a desire, that
he should steer a course for his lighthouse regardless
of everything else. If I have a plan of life it is to
row for my lighthouse, but not to miss the scenery
along the way. My boat may carry me past something
better than my lighthouse. If I should suddenly
find myself floating over an oyster-bed I
should stop to hunt pearls. I believe that as a man
pushes forward to his desire he should stand ready
to pounce on the treasure that chance or circumstance
floats in his way; he should be ready to repel
the evil he fears, but he should keep his ammunition
dry and his weapons loaded for trouble he doesn’t
in the least foresee—which is not likely to happen,
but which sometimes does happen. I believe that a
plan to arrive at one’s choice should be modified
by the happening of every moment, and that one
should be ready to abandon his boat, abandon his
lighthouse, to dive over the side after the chance-sent
mass of floating ambergris.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes, that’s it. The moment determines.
The mood of the moment determines,” said Marie.</p>

<p>“And,” said Jim, carried onward by the flow of
his thought, “meetings with other voyagers determine.
One’s course is sure to cross the courses of
others. At some point those moving at right angles
to each other may meet bow to bow, when there will
result collision, or else one or both the travelers
must modify their courses for a time. It may even
be that the adventure of one traveler will cause the
other to abandon his quest and follow. If you’re
going to look ahead, Miss Ducharme, and plan and
choose, you must not forget to estimate the chances
of contact with other planners and choosers, nor the
modifications contact may cause.”</p>

<p>Moran shrugged his shoulders, his jaw set.</p>

<p>“If another man’s path crosses mine, or his boat
gets in the way of mine, I let him look out for himself
or be run down,” he said, crisply.</p>

<p>“In such collisions,” said the widow, “I’ve knowed
both boats to be sunk.”</p>

<p>Jim felt Marie’s black eyes upon him, but he did
not look at her. She was studying him, appraising
him. He was conscious of it, yet endeavored to
appear unconscious. He felt she was more inclined
toward friendliness with him than ever before, and
because he perceived that she needed friendship—not
because of any leaning toward her—he feared
to show even by a glance that he was aware of a
better understanding between them. It would be
so easy to frighten her away.</p>

<p>Moran pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“I must catch my train, Mrs. Stickney. I always
enjoy my suppers with you. They remind me of
suppers I used to eat at grandmother’s farm.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing for men to git reminded of their
grandmothers once in a while,” she answered,
cryptically.</p>

<p>“You’re coming to see me to the door, Marie?”
Moran said. It seemed to Jim more a command
than a question. Marie obeyed, and the man and
girl left the room.</p>

<p>Jim emptied his coffee-cup, which was not a thing
to do quickly when the widow had made the coffee.
Indeed not! One sipped and tasted and stopped
betweenwhiles
to think on the aroma of it. Presently
Jim set down his empty cup.</p>

<p>“More?” asked the widow.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no.”</p>

<p>Jim moved back his chair. He was frowning at
the tablecloth abstractedly.</p>

<p>“Hum!” said the widow. It was a very significant,
expressive hum, an eloquent hum, but, withal,
a hum that needed further elucidation before it
became wholly and perfectly clear.</p>

<p>“The difference between girls,” she said, “is that
most of them is just ordinarily foolish.”</p>

<p>“And the difference between men,” said Jim, “is
that some of them are like Michael Moran.”</p>

<p>“I calc’late from that,” she said, “that your heart
don’t flow out to him in love and admiration.”</p>

<p>“It’s men like him that make murder a virtue.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said the widow. “I’ll say this for you,
you don’t leave folks fumblin’ round to understand
your meanin’.”</p>

<p>“I said exactly what I meant. Mrs. Stickney,
Miss Ducharme is in a dangerous humor. I can’t
make her out. Probably it is because I’m too young.
But you ought to understand her—whether she
means some of the reckless things she says. I
believe she does. She has intelligence and a will,
which makes the condition more dangerous. She
talks about choosing her course when Diversity
becomes unbearable. Michael Moran is planning
to be present when that time comes. Possibly his
plans include making Diversity unbearable. At any
rate, he plans and plans, and because he is what he
is, because she knows he is what he is, he offers her
an opportunity of escape. He offers her what she
thinks is an opportunity to choose. But it won’t
be any such thing. When she chooses—if ever she
does choose—to go to him, it will be because he has
planned it and forced the choice.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said the widow again, eying him with
eyes that age had not robbed of their brightness.
“Hum!”</p>

<p>This was no startling contribution to the conversation.
But the exclamation “Hum!” uttered by an
old woman who has buried two husbands and kept
boarders is not to be despised. There is more wisdom
in such a monosyllable than in all the pages of
the valedictory of a girl emerging from college—which
is generally credited with being an erudite message.
Two husbands and a succession of boarders
may teach things that even professors of sociology
have not had called to their attention.</p>

<p>“She’s so infernally alone,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Marie stepped into the dining-room again—one
might almost say pounced. Her eyes glittered, her
hands were clenched.</p>

<p>“I am infernally alone. Oh, I heard! I heard
what you said before that, I listened. What business
have you to discuss me and my affairs? I suppose
it’s your meddlesome notion to help me. I
don’t want help; I don’t need help; and what
help could you give? What do you know about me—or
about life? What do you know about a woman?
I will not be discussed by either of you. I have the
right to order my own life—to make it good or bad
as I want to—and it’s nobody’s business. Do you
think I don’t know Michael Moran? I tell you I
see into the farthest corner of his soul. I’m not
demanding happiness. I doubt if happiness is the
best thing life has to give. But I do demand to live.
Nobody can compel me to rot. What if I do suffer?
What if there is pain and suffering and remorse?
That is part of life. It is living. And you would
meddle! I tell you again that I see what I am doing;
that I am not deceived; that I have weighed consequences.
If the time comes when Michael Moran is
the stepping-stone I need, I shall use him. Nobody
can prevent it—”</p>

<p>“I calc’late there’s somebody might prevent it,
Marie,” said the widow, quietly, “and I calc’late
there’s somethin’ would fill you up with a kind of
regret you ain’t anticipatin’ if it was to happen
afterward.”</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded Marie, passionately. “And
what?”</p>

<p>“The man you loved might stop you—and comin’
to love a man afterward might bring that kind of
remorse that would make dyin’ better ’n livin’.”</p>

<p>Marie stared at the widow, then after one might
slowly have counted a dozen she sank into a chair
and gazed fixedly downward. Nobody spoke, Jim
felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Presently Marie lifted her eyes, first to Jim, then
to the widow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “that is possible. I could love,
but it would be better that I shouldn’t. Better
for him. If I loved it would be no pretty bill-and-coo.
It would be love. I should give much, but
demand much. I do not think it would be comfortable
to be loved by me. If I loved it would be the
one great concern of my life. I should have room
for nothing else. I have studied myself. And if he
did not love me as I loved him I should make him
unhappy, for I do not believe men like to be bothered
by too much love. I should make him hate me. I
should be no sweet domestic animal to greet him
with a kiss, and fetch him his slippers, and sit by
placidly while he read his paper. Men like comfort
and coddling. There would be no comfort with me.
I should be jealous—jealous even of the food that
gave him pleasure. What man wants such a love!
What happiness can come from it? Would you want
to be loved that way?” She turned abruptly to
Jim.</p>

<p>“I do not believe one can love too much. I don’t
believe you know what love is, Miss Ducharme. If
love is what I believe, it is not fierce, not a fire that
burns beyond control. I think it is gentle; I think
love forgives; I think real love manifests itself not
by clawing and scratching its object, but by spending
itself to procure his happiness—or her happiness.
I believe the true love of a man for his wife, or of a
woman for her husband, has much in it of the love
of father or mother for their child. I do not think
love threatens; it shelters. No, Miss Ducharme, the
thing you have been talking about is not love at all.
I don’t know what it is, but love it is not.”</p>

<p>She looked at him wide-eyed, startled, curious.</p>

<p>“When you love,” he said, “you will see that I
am right.”</p>

<p>“I should like to believe you, Mr. Ashe,” she said.
“It would be sweet—sweet. But you are wrong.
How could you know? Have you loved?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stickney spoke, her old eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem scarcely possible,” she said, “but
I’ve been in love. It was some number of years
ago, but I hain’t forgot all about it yet. Shouldn’t
be s’prised if there was times when I remembered it
right well. So I’m speakin’ from experience. When
I was in love ’twa’n’t exactly like either one of them
things you’ve been describin’. I’ll go so far’s to say
that both of you’ll know consid’able more about it
after you’ve ketched it.”</p>

<p>Jim felt a sense of relief. There had been a strain;
the moments that had passed were tense moments.
Possibly Marie, too, was relieved. At any rate,
she stood up, and as she walked toward the door she
spoke icily:</p>

<p>“Bear in mind, please, Mr. Ashe, that I and my
affairs are not to be discussed, nor have you a right
to interfere in whatever happens.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ducharme, I have that right. If I see a
man ill-treat a dog, I have the right to protect that
dog—more than that, it is my duty. How much
more is it a man’s right and duty to interfere in behalf
of a woman who is in danger!”</p>

<p>“Duty!” exclaimed Miss Ducharme.</p>

<h1 id='t4090'>CHAPTER XII</h1>

<p>Jim found Zaanan Frame at his desk, Tiffany’s
<span class='it'>Justices’ Guide</span> open before him as it always
was in his moments of leisure. Zaanan nodded.</p>

<p>“Set,” he said.</p>

<p>“Judge,” said Jim, “I’ve been invited to help beat
you at the next election.”</p>

<p>“Um!”</p>

<p>“They tell me a corporation hasn’t a chance with
you.”</p>

<p>“Some hain’t,” said Zaanan, briefly.</p>

<p>“And that a laboring-man gets all the best of it.”</p>

<p>“An even chance is the best of it for a poor feller,”
said Zaanan. “Calc’late you was fetchin’ me news?”
The old man’s eyes twinkled. “Moran’s a convincin’
talker,” he observed, after a brief pause.</p>

<p>Jim made no reply.</p>

<p>“Thinkin’ of throwin’ in with him?” Zaanan asked.</p>

<p>Jim started to speak, but stopped, startled. It
seemed to him for an instant that Marie Ducharme
sat before him. He could see her move with the
wonderful grace that was hers; he could see the sure,
graceful lines of her figure; he could see her face,
mobile, intelligent, with possibilities that would
have made it interesting, even compelling, but for
the expression of sullen discontent that masked it.
So real, so material did she seem, that it seemed to
Jim he could stretch out his hand and touch her.
Then she was gone.</p>

<p>Jim’s teeth clicked together, and his good, square-cornered
jaw set.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’m going to do,” he said, with
that sudden resolution which seemed to have become
a part of him. “I’m going to chase Michael Moran
out of Diversity County.”</p>

<p>“Um! Hain’t you perty busy savin’ your own
goods from the fire?”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep mine and add something of his,” Jim
said, grimly.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, sich things has been done. Ever hear
tell of Watt Peters and his bear? Watt he was
campin’ with a crowd back in the timber, huntin’
bear. One day he was cruisin’ round and come on to
a old he-bear consid’rable more sudden than he
calc’lated on. Watt he never got famous for boldness,
so this time he clean forgot he was huntin’ bear
and turned and run for all was in him. Seems like he
irritated that bear somehow, for he turned to and
chased Watt ’most to camp. Watt he tripped over a
root and like to busted his neck. Old bear he kept
a-comin’. Wasn’t anything for it but to shoot, so
Watt he up and shot. Dummed if he didn’t kill
that there bear deader ’n a door-nail. Fellers in
camp came a-runnin’ out.</p>

<p>“‘’Most catched you, didn’t he?’ says a feller.</p>

<p>“‘Catched me!’ says Watt. ‘What you mean,
catched me?’</p>

<p>“‘He was a-chasin’ you, wasn’t he?’</p>

<p>“Watt he looked scornful-like and answered right
up:</p>

<p>“‘Think I want to lug a bear two mile into camp?’
says he. ‘No, sir, I lured this here bear in so’s I
could kill him handy to where I wanted him. I
jest figgered to make him carry himself into camp,’
says he. Wa-al, young feller, things does happen
that way sometimes, but it looks to me right now
like the bear was chasin’ you.”</p>

<p>“I know Moran is in with Welliver and his bunch.
I know Moran is at the bottom of the trouble we’re
having at the mill. He’s having our logs spiked,
and a man of his is tampering with our machinery.
I know it, but I can’t prove it even to myself. The
first thing I do is to make certain.”</p>

<p>“If I was goin’ to take a drive,” said Zaanan.
“I’d take the River Road. Calc’late I’d drive till
I come to where a beech and a maple’s growin’ so
clost it looks like they come up from one root, and
I’d up and hitch there. Then I’d walk off to the
right, takin’ care to make plenty of noise so’s not to
seem like I was sneakin’. About that election, Jim,
I calc’late I’m obleeged to you. G’-by, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Judge,” said Jim.</p>

<p>He went to the livery for a rig and presently was
driving out the River Road according to Zaanan’s
directions. It seemed like a long time before he
discovered Zaanan’s landmark, but it appeared at
last, and Jim was interested to see that another horse
had been tied there not long ago. The marks of its
pawing hoofs were visible in the soft soil; the work
of its teeth showed on the bark of the tree. It was
here that Dolf Springer had tied not many hours
before.</p>

<p>Jim looked about him for some indication of
man’s presence that would show him how to proceed,
but there was none. Away from him on all sides
stretched a growth of scrub-oak and jack-pine, with
here and there the grayed and splintered shaft of an
ancient pine that had been riven by lightning or
broken off by wind or age. There was no path, no
sign of human usage.</p>

<p>Forgetting Zaanan’s caution to proceed noisily,
Jim walked slowly, almost stealthily, through the
underbrush. He did so unconsciously; it was the
natural impulse of one walking into the unknown.
At times he stopped to look about him, dubious if
he had not alighted at the wrong landmark.</p>

<p>Presently he fancied he heard voices and stopped
to listen with straining ears. Unquestionably there
were voices. Jim drew nearer softly, and in a few
moments reached a point where words and tones
and inflections could be distinguished. There was
a man’s voice and a child’s voice. Jim stopped again
and listened. The conversation he overheard was
not a conversation; it was a ritual. As the words
came to Jim he knew it was but one repetition of
what had been conned and repeated many times
before. Yet there was fire in it, fire and
fierce determination.</p>

<p>“Where is your mother?” asked the man’s voice.</p>

<p>“Dead,” answered the child’s.</p>

<p>“Who killed her?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“She killed herself,” said the child.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“On account of me.”</p>

<p>“Did she do right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who do you hate?”</p>

<p>“Michael Moran,” said the child.</p>

<p>“What have you got to do?”</p>

<p>“Pay Michael Moran.”</p>

<p>“You won’t ever forget?”</p>

<p>“I won’t ever forget,” said the child.</p>

<p>“See to it that you don’t,” the man said,
fiercely.</p>

<p>It was evident the ritual was at an end; that this
last was an admonition, not a part of it. Jim shivered
but he knew he had not gone astray, that here was
the man Zaanan had sent him to see. He retired
softly a hundred feet, then called aloud and floundered
toward the spot where the ritual had been
spoken.</p>

<p>Jim had not traversed half the distance before a
man stepped from behind a mound. It was the same
big, handsome, somber man whom Dolf Springer
had called upon; it was Steve Gilders. Under his
arm was the rifle that had sent a shiver up Dolf’s
spine.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for somebody?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes. Judge Frame sent me.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Ashe.”</p>

<p>“Own the new mills down to Diversity?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Are you the man I came to see?”</p>

<p>“Calc’late so. Names is handy in talkin’ to folks.
Mine’s Steve.”</p>

<p>Jim thought it best not to ask additional names.</p>

<p>“What was you wantin’?” Steve asked.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s playing hob with my machinery and
driving spikes into my logs for me to rip off sawteeth
on. I think Michael Moran is at the bottom of
it, but I want to prove it to myself.”</p>

<p>“If you kin prove it—what?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a better conscience to go after the
man.”</p>

<p>“Not after him personal. You won’t lay hands
on him? You hain’t figgerin’ on doin’ anythin’ to
his body, be you? ’Cause I can’t have that. That
hain’t your concern. It’s a job for somebody else.”</p>

<p>“No. But I’m going to drive him out of Diversity.”</p>

<p>Steve smiled. “If you was to take his money
away from him and his power away from him,
why I’d be glad. It ’u’d hurt him mighty bad.
But I calc’late he hain’t goin’ to be drove out of
Diversity. I figger he’s goin’ to stay here
permanent—permanent as them in Diversity’s graveyard.”</p>

<p>Jim wondered if the man were not off the mental
perpendicular; but a glance at his fine if stern face,
his clear eyes, his bearing, argued strongly in favor
of his sanity. Perhaps the man was possessed of
some Old Testament spirit of vengeance; perhaps
here was a Northern relative of the blood feud of the
Kentucky mountains. In spite of himself he felt
apprehensive for Moran’s sake.</p>

<p>“You want proofs, eh? Be you enured to walkin’?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Seven miles to the loggin’-road,” said Steve.</p>

<p>“I’d better care for my horse then.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to him. You set right where you be.”
It was a command. Jim recognized it as such and
obeyed.</p>

<p>It was not long before Steve returned. He did not
take Jim to his shanty as he had taken Dolf Springer,
but led him straight through the woods toward the
southeast. Steve tramped silently. The things his
eyes saw, the things his ears heard, and the thoughts
moving in his mind were company enough for him.
As for Jim, he had difficulty enough maintaining
the pace without wasting breath in unnecessary
words.</p>

<p>After an hour’s steady going Steve stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“Set,” he said. “You hain’t used to this.”</p>

<p>Jim sank down without a word. Steve leaned
against a maple trunk, for they were now getting
into the edge of the hardwood, and took out his pipe.
Neither spoke for fifteen minutes. Then Steve
straightened up and nodded. Jim got to his feet
and followed.</p>

<p>In another hour Steve spoke again: “Road’s
right over there. First landin’s half a mile up.”</p>

<p>They turned to the left and shortly were in last
season’s slashings. Narrow lanes among the trees,
uneven, impassable to teams at this season of the
year, marked the tote roads, which in winter would
be cared for more skilfully than many a city
boulevard, iced, kept clear of refuse, so that heavily
ladened sleds might pass smoothly, carrying logs
from cutting to landings.</p>

<p>Jim heard the toot of a locomotive whistle and
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Must be the empty trucks up from the mill,” he
said.</p>

<p>Steve nodded.</p>

<p>The engine with its trail of trucks passed them at
their right, whistled again, and at last came to a
stop. Jim knew the stop was at the landing from
which came his logs.</p>

<p>“Where’s the camp?” he asked.</p>

<p>“T’other side of the track.”</p>

<p>In a moment they were at the edge of the clearing
and Jim could see the landing, its skidways piled
high with hardwood logs, beech, birch, maple, with
here and there a soft maple, an ash or an oak. The
train crew had already disappeared in the direction
of the camp; only one man was visible, standing in
the doorway of the sealer’s shanty. He looked after
the trainmen, then emerged and mounted a skid way.
With a big blue crayon he marked log after log.
These, Jim knew, were being selected to go to his
mill in the morning. Then the man returned to his
shanty.</p>

<p>Presently he appeared with a blacksmith’s hammer.
He mounted the skidway again, knelt upon a
marked log, and drove a spike into it near the middle.
This he proceeded to sink with a punch.</p>

<p>Steve did not so much as turn his head toward
Jim. He merely watched the man with a curious
intentness. The man repeated the operation five
times on different logs, then returned his tools to
the shanty and sauntered away toward the camp.</p>

<p>Jim felt a hot flame of rage. With characteristic
impulse he started to his feet and would have demanded
a reckoning of the man there and then,
but Steve caught him by the arm and drew him
down.</p>

<p>“Hungry?” he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>“Maybe I am,” snapped Jim, “but I’m too mad to
notice it.”</p>

<p>“Spring back here. I put a snack in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“What’s that man’s name, Steve?” Jim demanded.</p>

<p>“Kowterski—one of Moran’s Polacks,” said
Steve, with bitterness in his voice. “Them cattle
is drivin’ good woodsmen out of the State. Moran’s
fetchin’ ’em in ’cause he kin drive ’em and abuse ’em
and rob ’em. There was a day when a lumberjack
come out of the woods after the drive with his pockets
burnin’ with money. These fellers is lucky if they
come out even. I knowed one that come out last
spring with fifteen dollars to show for his winter’s
work. Sometimes Moran gives ’em half a dollar
on Sundays—for church!” He stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“Kowterski’s brother’s night-watchin’ for you,” he
said, shortly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jim. “Now let’s go back.”</p>

<p>“Better eat a bite,” Steve said, and, taking Jim’s
assent for granted, led the way to the spring.</p>

<p>It was an hour before he consented to begin the
backward tramp. It was completed as silently as
had been the coming. Steve led Jim past his
shanty, but not in sight of it, and to the road where
the buggy stood.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said, and shortly reappeared, leading
the horse, which he helped Jim to hitch.</p>

<p>Jim climbed to the seat and extended his hand.
Steve made no movement to take it.</p>

<p>“I’m more obliged to you than I can say,” Jim
said.</p>

<p>“G’-by,” Steve said, briefly, and, turning his back,
strode out of sight among the scrub-oak and jack-pine.</p>

<p>The horse Jim drove was not intended by nature to
travel rapidly from place to place. He possessed
two paces, one a studious walk, the other a self-satisfied
trot that was a negligible acceleration of
movement. So it was dusk when Jim reached Diversity.
Slow as the progress was, it did not give
Jim time to cool down from the boiling-point he had
reached; instead, it irritated him, brought him where
explosion was inevitable.</p>

<p>He returned his horse to the barn and started down
the street toward the mill, forgetful that he had
eaten nothing but Steve’s snack since breakfast.
As he passed the hotel he saw Moran on the piazza—Moran,
who had taken a train yesterday to the
city.</p>

<p>Jim stopped, gripped his temper with both hands,
as it were, to hold it in check, and spoke.</p>

<p>“You’re back soon,” he said.</p>

<p>“Didn’t get to the city at all. Wire met me halfway
and called me back.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Jim, with another of his sudden
resolutions. “I’m glad you’re here. Can you
walk down to the mill with me? I want to show you
something.”</p>

<p>“Glad to,” said Moran, rising.</p>

<p>The older man attempted casual talk as they went
along, but Jim’s answers were monosyllabic, even
brusk. Moran studied the young man’s face out
of the corner of his eye, wondering what was in the
wind. He was puzzled, uneasy, and he ceased his
conversation and speculated on possibilities.</p>

<p>Jim led him round to the rear of the mill. At the
fire-room door he paused and called, “Kowterski!”</p>

<p>Presently a bulky figure emerged from the gloom
that was beyond the doorway. The man was big,
with a clumsy bigness, not so tall as Jim, but heavier
by fifty pounds. He came forward slowly.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Jim. “Come here.”</p>

<p>Kowterski recognized Jim and ducked his head.</p>

<p>“Evenin’, boss,” he said, then looked into Jim’s
face. Something he saw was disquieting, for he
halted, took a step backward, started to raise his
hands.</p>

<p>Putting the weight of his body into the blow, Jim
struck him. Kowterski stumbled, went down. He
lay still an instant where he had fallen, then wallowed
to his knees and remained in that position,
mumblingly ridding his mouth of blood and teeth.</p>

<p>“Git!” said Jim.</p>

<p>Kowterski rose, wavering, turned, and ran stumblingly
away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Jim turned to Moran. “Good night,” he said,
shortly.</p>

<p>“You had something to show me,” said Moran,
thrown from his habitual poise.</p>

<p>“That was it,” Jim said, and disappeared into the
fire-room.</p>

<h1 id='t4550'>CHAPTER XIII</h1>

<p>That night Jim patrolled the mill in the place of
the watchman whose resignation he had accepted
in front of the fire-room door. Through the long,
dark hours he had time and quiet for reflection. His
mind was stimulated by the occurrences of the day;
he was aware of a clarity of vision, a straightness of
thought, a satisfying concentration. His problem, in
all its intricate difficulties, lay plain before him. He
fancied he had read astutely his enemies’ plans; his
own plans began to take form.</p>

<p>Against Welliver and the Clothespin Club he would
have to defend himself by business makeshifts and
financial strategy. Them he did not underestimate
nor did he exaggerate their menace. To defend himself
against Moran his best course was to attack.
It would now become his business to seek for a point
of weakness, and there to deliver his first blow.</p>

<p>It was common talk that Moran was reaching out
ambitiously. His former holdings had been considerable;
now the affairs which he seemed to control
were of magnitude. He had traveled from the
one to the other in a short space, a space so short
that Jim felt sure it had not been sufficient to
multiply his fortune. It forced itself upon Jim
that Moran must have spread himself out thinly to
cover so much ground. In that case there must be
a point where he had spread himself with dangerous
thinness. That area, Jim thought, he must find.
There, he said to himself, he must strike.</p>

<p>It was daylight when he left the mill and trudged
wearily toward his bed at the widow’s. On his way
he met John Beam, who regarded him with amazement.</p>

<p>“Up kind of early, ain’t you?” asked Beam.</p>

<p>“No, just a bit late to bed,” Jim said, with a grin
of boyishness. “By the way, you’ll have to get a
new watchman to take Kowterski’s place. I took it
last night.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“When he left,” said Jim, a trifle grimly, “I
thought of advising him to go to the dentist’s.”</p>

<p>He looked down at his bruised, abrased knuckles.
Beam’s eyes followed his employer’s and the man
grinned with sudden comprehension.</p>

<p>“It was him, eh?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “I won’t be down till afternoon.”</p>

<p>Beam walked on his way, chuckling. Presently
he encountered Nels Nelson and recounted what he
had learned, with certain amendments and surmises
of his own, ending with a special word regarding
Jim.</p>

<p>“Some boss,” he said, delightedly. “I’ve had a
few bosses, but Sudden Jim he’s the boy for my
money.” Which would have pleased Jim exceedingly
had he overheard it.</p>

<p>Jim devoured the breakfast the widow had ready
for him, and went off to bed. He went to sleep
with the satisfying consciousness that it was now open
warfare between him and Moran. What he had
done last night was both a declaration of war and an
eloquent expression of his opinion of the man. He
knew Moran would be able to translate it correctly.</p>

<p>It was after one o’clock when Jim awoke, but he
found the widow had kept his dinner warm for him.</p>

<p>“’S my experience,” she said, severely, “that folks
gits more for their money sleepin’ nights than daytimes.”</p>

<p>“I was behaving myself, Mrs. Stickney. Honestly
I was. At regular rates I earned two dollars watching
in the mill.”</p>

<p>“I was kind of disap’inted in you when you didn’t
come home at all. But, ‘Boys will be boys,’ says I,
‘which won’t prevent my speakin’ my mind to him
if he hain’t ready with a good excuse, which mostly
young men is ready with and ain’t usually believed;
but what kin a body do about it?’”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll do nothing rash,” Jim said, with
specious soberness. “You won’t put me out in the
street, will you?”</p>

<p>“If it had been any of my husbands I’ll bet I’d ’a’
knowed the reason why,” she said, and disappeared
into the kitchen, with an aggrieved air.</p>

<p>Jim went out smiling; somehow the widow’s
threatened scolding put him in a better humor with
the world. It was good to know that somebody in
Diversity had a real, friendly, motherly interest in
him.</p>

<p>His way led past Zaanan Frame’s office. Zaanan
was standing on the step.</p>

<p>“Afternoon,” said the old justice. “Hain’t much
battered up as I kin see.”</p>

<p>“I’m practically intact,” Jim said, gaily.</p>

<p>“Folks round town has it there was consid’able
trouble to the mill last night. You was reported
laid up in bed with grievous injuries. Calc’lated I’d
come round to see you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I just took Moran down to
point out a circumstance to him.”</p>

<p>“Moran? What’s he got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Jim, “I met him when I got back
to town and invited him down to the mill with me.
I—er—rid myself of Mr. Kowterski in his presence
and left him to think it over. Haven’t seen him
since.”</p>

<p>“He hain’t got any misgivin’s as to how you stand
then, eh? You kind of rubbed his face in it, didn’t
you? Leetle bit abrupt, wasn’t you?”</p>

<p>“If there’s going to be a fight,” said Jim, “I want
it to be a fight. No sneaking under cover.”</p>

<p>“Call to mind that British general—what’s his
name? Bradley—Bradish—some sich thing. Didn’t
pay no heed to a young feller named Washington
when he was goin’ to fight the Injuns. He come
right out bold to fight like you’re aimin’ to do.
But did the Injuns? Wa-al, accounts says not.
They done consid’able sneaking and prowlin’ under
cover, and this general got all chawed up.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want the man to think I was a fool.”</p>

<p>“Um! Shows you’re young, Jim. Hain’t no
better way of gittin’ a strangle holt on to a feller than
by lettin’ him think you’re a fool. The s’prise of
findin’ out sudden that you hain’t comes nigh to
chokin’ him.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it’s done,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“No argyin’ that p’int. I notice Moran didn’t
leave town this mornin’ like he calc’lated to. What
you figgerin’ on next? Looks like you run on to
some facts up the River Road.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look for some more facts.”</p>

<p>“What kind of facts, son?”</p>

<p>“Moran’s got a thin spot. I want to find it.”</p>

<p>“Um! Thin spot. Calc’late I understand you.
Figger he’s been spreadin’ his butter so thin that
the bread won’t be covered enough somewheres,
eh? Maybe so. Maybe so. Ever see a map of the
Diversity Hardwood Company’s holdin’s?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I got one. Had the Register of Deeds fix it up
for me, thinkin’ it might come in handy.”</p>

<p>Zaanan went to a cupboard and brought out a
rolled map which he spread on the table. It was
marked off in sections. Those owned by the company
were blocked in with red ink.</p>

<p>“Nigh forty-five thousand acres,” said Zaanan.</p>

<p>Jim bent over the map. The Diversity Company’s
property ran in two irregular, serrated strips.
Between the two portions was a sort of strait nowhere
marked with red.</p>

<p>“They’re cut in two,” said Jim. “Who owns the
stuff between? Timbered, is it?”</p>

<p>“As good hardwood as ever growed. B’longs to
old Louis Le Bar. Run between twenty and twenty-five
thousand to the acre. And that’s consid’able
hardwood, son.”</p>

<p>“Logically the company ought to own it.”</p>

<p>“Logically it wants to, but old Louis won’t sell.
Anyhow, he wouldn’t.” Zaanan emphasized the last
word significantly. Jim looked across the table into
the old man’s twinkling eyes, shrewd, kindly eyes
belonging to a man who had learned humankind by
scores of years of meeting with them in their
adversities. Zaanan said no more, but rolled up his
map.</p>

<p>“I take it,” said Jim, “that you’ve shown me a
fact. One of the kind I was looking for.”</p>

<p>“Folks says Opportunity knocks on a feller’s
door,” said Zaanan. “Maybe so, but more times
it goes sneakin’ past his house quiet in the dark.
And sometimes it’s hard to catch as a greased pig.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” Jim said. “Where will I find
Le Bar?”</p>

<p>“Stiddy, now. Stiddy. Before you pick up that
animile be sure it’s a cat and not a skunk. You’re
one of them pouncin’ kind of young men. This
here’s a time to study first and jump afterward.”</p>

<p>Then an unusual thing happened. Dolf Springer
burst in without knocking. He was excited, greatly
excited, or he never would have ventured, for
Zaanan’s office was sacred.</p>

<p>“Judge,” he panted, “what d’you think? They’ve
up and done it. Didn’t b’lieve they’d dast, but they
did dast. They’ve up and announced Peleg Goodwin
to run ag’in you for justice of the peace.”</p>

<p>Zaanan eyed his henchman. “Git a breath, Dolf.
Git a breath. Like’s not you’ll suffocate. Hum!
Peleg, eh?” He turned to Jim. “Seem like old
times,” he said; “hain’t had no opposition for the
nomination in more ’n twenty year. Peleg Goodwin,
deacon by perfession.”</p>

<p>“I told you,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Zaanan peered at him briefly and grunted.</p>

<p>“I hain’t so young as I was wunst,” he said.
“Maybe my powers is flaggin’. Maybe this here
is a spontaneous uprisin’ of the folks, thinkin’ maybe
it’s time I was put on the shelf. But, son, I don’t
hanker to go on no shelf—anyhow, not to make room
for Peleg. But it was bound to come some day.
Folks likes change, and I’ve been mighty permanent.”</p>

<p>The old man leaned back in his chair and looked
beyond Jim and Dolf; forgot them as his thoughts
carried him back over the years. When he spoke
it was not to them, it was to the people, to his people,
whom he had served and ruled for more than a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>“Yes, folks,” says he, “what some of you is sayin’
is correct. I calc’late I’m a boss. But if you was to
look at my bank account or search out my property
you’d see I wasn’t that kind of a boss. I’ve run
things in this county ’cause I was more fitted to run
’em than you. I’d have liked it if you’d ’a’ had the
spunk and gumption to run things yourselves. I’ve
let you try it sometimes, and then had to clean up the
mess.</p>

<p>“Don’t think, folks, that all these years has been
pleasure for me, nor what I’d ’a’ picked out to do.
No, siree! When I was younger there was things
I had ambitions about. I wanted to git somewheres
and be somethin’. But I hain’t had no time. I
hain’t had no time to spare to look after Zaanan
Frame, owin’ to matters of yourn that was always
pressin’. Diversity wa’n’t no heaven when I took
holt of it, but now it’s a good place for man to live.
I’ve made the laws respected and obeyed; since I’ve
been justice one man’s had as much chance in this
county as another.</p>

<p>“The days and nights I might ’a’ spent buildin’ up
Zaanan Frame I’ve spent buildin’ up you. But I
guess you’re tired of it. If it was a good man and
a true man and a man worthy of trust I calc’late I
could step out of the way. There’s times when I
git mighty tired. But not for Peleg. Dolf,” he said,
sharply, “I guess we’ll have to show Peleg and the
feller that’s puttin’ him up to this some real politics.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” said Dolf.</p>

<p>“It’s Moran,” Jim said; but the statement was
half a question.</p>

<p>“He’s the citizen,” said Zaanan.</p>

<p>“They’ll try to get you in the caucus.”</p>

<p>Zaanan nodded. “Dolf,” said he, “if you was
goin’ out to talk about this, what would you be
sayin’?”</p>

<p>“That we was goin’ to roll up our sleeves and lick
the pants off’n ’em,” said Dolf, belligerently.</p>

<p>“Don’t calc’late you’d say I was perty hard hit?
Eh? Sort of insinuate the blow bore down on my
threescore and ten year? Nor that there didn’t
seem to be scarcely any fight left in me?”</p>

<p>“Dummed if I—” began Dolf. Then he stopped
and looked at Zaanan. “Guess maybe that’s about
what I’d say,” he responded, presently.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Dolf,” said Zaanan.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Judge,” said Dolf.</p>

<p>“Tain’t only me,” said Zaanan, after a time, “it’s
the sheriff and the prosecutor and the circuit judge—the
whole kit and b’ilin’ of us. There won’t be a
decent official left in the county. Law and justice’ll
be bought and sold and traded in like so much farm
produce.”</p>

<p>“I want to help if I can,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Calc’late I’ll need what help I kin git. Moran
don’t usually start a job he can’t see his way to
finish. I’ll call on you when you’re needed. Louis
Le Bar lives four mile to the west. How’s things
at the widder’s? Do consid’able cacklin’ over you,
does she?” He stopped and scratched his head and
appeared to ponder. “Say, young feller,” he said,
in a few moments, “what’s your special grudge ag’in
Moran? Tain’t jest his business dealin’s with you.
It’s him you want to git at, ree-gardless. What’s
he done to you?”</p>

<p>“There’s a girl up at Mrs. Stickney’s—” Jim began,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Zaanan, and his eyes twinkled.
“Moran hain’t in no position to cut you out with a
girl. He’s got more wife ’n he knows what to do
with now.”</p>

<p>Jim felt himself flushing. He had not connected
Marie Ducharme with himself in the way Zaanan
connected her. He had not considered his hatred
of Moran as prompted by jealousy, nor had he looked
on Moran as a rival. It was a new idea to him. He
considered it. What interest had he in Marie?
Did he even like her? He had fancied he disliked
her for her sullenness, her rashness, for the bitterness
of her temper toward the world. She was all somber
shadows or lurid flame; there was no rosiness of
dawn, no brightness of noontime, no peaceful, pure
light as of the stars.</p>

<p>When Jim had thought of the woman who was to
share his life he had pictured her as bright with
star-brightness. He would stand something in awe of
her, yet her brightness would not be cold, aloof—not
cold moon rays. It would be tender, glowing, throbbing,
but, above all, pure, inspiringly pure. Marie
knew evil. Her discontent had seen its beckoning
finger; she had felt the persuasive touch of its hand
on her arm—and had not fled in horror. She eyed
it cynically, plumbing its possibilities. Jim’s girl
would have felt herself indelibly smirched by
thoughts that Marie gave willing housing to. Withal,
what did he think of her? What was his interest in
her? He could not answer. He dared not answer
himself, for he found himself contemplating her with
fascination. There was an appeal to her. Her possibilities
were magnificent. He found himself wishing
for her presence, for the sight of her movements of
grace, the sound of her voice, the vivid life desire
that lay in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Moran takes her to the top of a high mountain
and shows her the kingdoms of the world,” he said,
in a hard voice. “He offers them to her.”</p>

<p>“And you’re afraid she’ll accept?”</p>

<p>“She hates Diversity; life discontents her. She
is bored. Moran plans deliberately, adds lure to
lure. If he catches her in the mood—”</p>

<p>“Interestin’ girl, eh? Talk intelligent? Good company?”</p>

<p>“She can be if she chooses.”</p>

<p>“Ever try to git her to choose?”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t like me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Hain’t much in the way of excitement in
Diversity, but pleasure’s where you look for it hard
enough. I call to mind enjoyin’ buggy rides.
Ever try to make things pleasant for Marie?”</p>

<p>“No.” Jim said it with a guilty feeling.</p>

<p>“My experience,” said Zaanan, “is that the run of
girls prefers a decent, entertainin’ young man to a
bad old one. In gen’ral my notion is folks’d rather
be good than bad, rather pick out right than wrong.
Buggy hire don’t come expensive.” The old fellow
eyed Jim with a twinkle.</p>

<p>Jim returned Zaanan’s look; comprehension came
to him.</p>

<p>“Judge Frame,” he demanded, “did you send me
to Mrs. Stickney’s because Marie Ducharme was
there?” The twinkle in his eye answered Zaanan’s.
“Was I just a checker you were moving in your
game?”</p>

<p>“It’s my policy,” said Zaanan, “to git as many
young checkers as I could moved safe into the
king row of marriage.”</p>

<p>“But she dislikes me.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t heard you say you was prejudiced ag’in
her. Ever ask her if she disliked you? Um! Better
try a few buggy rides first. Kin you drive with one
hand?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Jim, “you’d try to regulate the
sex of Diversity’s babies.”</p>

<p>“If I calc’lated it’d benefit the town I dun’no’
but I’d kind of look into the matter. G’-by, Jim!”</p>

<h1 id='t4998'>CHAPTER XIV</h1>

<p>As the days went by Jim Ashe acquired a marked
aversion to the upper right-hand drawer of his
desk. For it contained the unpaid bills of the
Ashe Clothespin Company. When Jim came the
drawer had been empty; now it looked as if he would
have to add an annex to care for the overflow.
There were supply bills, machinery bills, stock bills.
And Jim did not dare to pay them, for his account
at the bank was running perilously low. Bills may
be put off, but the pay-roll must be met on the
minute.</p>

<p>From nothing the unsecured indebtedness climbed
to five thousand, to ten thousand dollars. Much as
it grieved Jim to see discount days pass with discounts
not taken, it grieved Grierson more. He had
served the company for many years. Never before
in his experience had it failed to discount its bills—and
to a bookkeeper of Grierson’s type discounts are
sacred. Grierson’s type of mind would borrow
money at six per cent. to take a two-per-cent. discount.</p>

<p>Finally statements began to arrive, some
accompanied by letters setting forth in the polite verbiage
of the business world that the creditor would be
glad to have the company’s check “for this small
amount at its convenience.” Dunning letters!
Grierson was shocked. He blushed as he bent over
his ledgers. The Ashe Clothespin Company had to
be dunned as if it were a dubious individual with an
overlarge bill at the corner grocery.</p>

<p>Jim was not yet the complete business man, but
he did discover that certain larger creditors were
willing to accept notes for the time, notes bearing
interest at six per cent. Somehow it relieved his
anxiety to issue this paper. At any rate, it postponed
the day of reckoning in each case for three or
four months. But Grierson was bitterly ashamed.
He regarded it as such a makeshift as an unstable
enterprise would avail itself of to ward off insolvency.
Jim caught the old bookkeeper looking
at him accusingly. Such things had never come to
pass in his father’s day.</p>

<p>Yet these were the very things Clothespin Jimmy
had predicted. He had told Jim there would be
sleepless nights and anxious days; he had confessed to
milking the business. Now Jim appreciated what his
father meant. With the fifty thousand dollars which
Clothespin Jimmy had subtracted from the assets the
company would be as sound as the Bank of England.</p>

<p>What worried Jim more than the accumulation of
bills was the failure to make shipments as rapidly as
the necessities required. Where he should have
shipped a car-load a day he had been able to bill out
an average of less than four cars a week. Customers
clamored to have their orders filled; cancellations
were threatened; yet the mill failed to produce as it
should produce. Somewhere something was wrong.
Clothespin-machines that ought to have made their
eighty five-gross boxes a day did not climb above
sixty. Total shipments that should have amounted
to thirty thousand dollars a month faltered and
failed at fifteen or sixteen thousand. In short, he
was spending every week a great deal more money
than he was earning.</p>

<p>Much of this, he knew, was due to breakdowns
caused by Kowterski; some of it to poor timber;
some to timber spiked by Kowterski’s brother. But
aside from that, changes had to be made in machines;
the mill did not run smoothly. Where construction
should have ceased to lay its expense on the company
it continued to demand its thousands of dollars
every month.</p>

<p>But Kowterski was gone. Jim did not believe
Moran would venture to send down more spiked
timber. The mill was slowly but surely rising to a
point of efficiency. Jim was confident in it; he
placed full dependence on Nels Nelson, his millwright,
on Beam, his superintendent. He knew they
were doing their intelligent best and that their
worries stood shoulder to shoulder with his own.
Given time, he would be firm on his feet; given
capital to carry him through this dubious period,
and the company would pay bigger dividends, reach
a more stable credit than it had ever before enjoyed.
But the time and the capital!</p>

<p>In his heart he knew that if one creditor lost faith
and brought pressure to bear, the whole edifice would
come down in ruin. Construction, rebuilding, repairs,
had devoured the money that should have paid
bills. Bills had multiplied by reason of supplies
necessary for construction. One thing was
essential—construction must cease. Men employed in
construction must be laid off.</p>

<p>“Grierson,” he said, “make me a statement of our
condition—a full statement; one that will show
everything and show it truly. I’m going to see if
there isn’t somebody in the world who will appreciate
being told the whole uncolored truth.”</p>

<p>With this statement in his pocket Jim went to the
city to its largest bank.</p>

<p>“I’m Ashe, of the Ashe Clothespin Company up
at Diversity,” he told the president, “and I’m in a
hole. I’ve got to have some money.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got lots of it,” the president said, genially,
“if you can show us. Let’s look into the hole you’re
in and see.”</p>

<p>Jim gave him the statement; it was fully, minutely
itemized. Every debit was shown in full; no credit
was inflated. The banker studied it half an hour,
nodding now and then.</p>

<p>“Would you attach your name to that statement?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“You believe you can make money?”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Show me,” said the banker, and Jim showed him
for an hour. He gave production figures, costs,
prices, profits.</p>

<p>“It’s a good statement, a sound statement,” the
banker said. “You have no quick assets—that’s
bad. That demand-paper I don’t like; but
otherwise—otherwise it is a very creditable statement.”</p>

<p>Jim was astonished.</p>

<p>“How much do you want?” the banker asked.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five thousand dollars,” Jim said, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I guess we can fix that up. The board meets at
noon. Can you come in and tell them your story?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You believe twenty-five thousand dollars will
bring your mill to efficiency and carry you to a
point where your own sales will take care of expenses?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Come in at twelve, then, and we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Jim returned at twelve and repeated his facts to
the assembled board. Before they broke up Jim
had given them the company’s note for twenty-five
thousand dollars, had that amount on deposit in
the bank, and a book of blank checks under his arm.</p>

<p>“We’ve passed this loan,” said a white-haired old
gentleman, “because we like the moral risk. Your
statement was fair; what you have said to us was
spoken as an honest man speaks. You seem to have
gotten a dollar of value for every dollar you have
put into this mill, and we hope you’ll win out.
We believe you will or we wouldn’t be lending you
our money. You haven’t evaded a question; you
haven’t held anything back. You’ve confessed to
us that you thought you were in a bad hole, which
is a poor argument for a borrower to bring forward.
Maybe we’d have lent you on the security of the
mills; maybe not. What we’ve done is to lend it
on the security of you. I say this to you because it
must give you pleasure to hear it and because it gives
me pleasure to be able to say it. I cannot say such
things as often as I wish. Now go to it, young man,
and lick the stuffing out of that other crowd.”</p>

<p>Jim went out, his head in a pink cloud, his feet
treading something lighter than mundane pavement.
Why, they had not thought he was in a hole at all!
The things Grierson and he had looked on as scarcely
creditable makeshifts were approved as sound business,
and they had given him money. How easy
money was to get! It astonished him. Thirty
thousand dollars he had borrowed from the Diversity
Bank, with no difficulty; twenty-five thousand more
poured into his purse from the City Bank, with
compliments attached. His policy had won. He
had found some one who appreciated being told the
whole uncolored truth. After all, the world had not
trampled its ideals into the mire of money-chasing.
Even to-day the sound things of life commanded a
market value. Business men, in high places of
trust, business men of tested capacity, placed the
moral before the material risk.</p>

<p>The president of the bank had said, “I would
rather lend a known honorable man money on
doubtful security than to venture a loan to a dubious
man on Government bonds.”</p>

<p>So Jim brought back from the city more than
money. He brought back a renewed, an increased
faith in the virtue of mankind. It was an asset
not to be despised. The mighty hand of business
reached out to encourage, to help with concrete aid,
the honest man. It withheld its support, even
though ample security were offered, from the man
whose honor was dubious. Therefore, this modern
god of business was a virtuous god. If evil were
committed in its name the god itself was not smirched
save in the eyes of the ignorant; if false sacrifices
were offered to it by charlatans and liars and cheats,
by jack priests of commerce, the god was not more
dishonored than is the God of Israel by horrors that
have been committed in His name.</p>

<p>As Jim rode home on the train his first feeling of
elation dwindled. Doubt returned. He weighed
the sides of his ledger against each other and determined
all was not yet secure. How could it be
secure when he had but added to his liability the
not inconsiderable sum of twenty-five thousand dollars?
Part of his debts he could pay. The balance
must wait, for he could not divest himself of ready
money, nor would the reserve he could set aside last
forever.</p>

<p>The demand-note of thirty thousand dollars reared
itself as a threat, assumed the guise of a poised bird
of prey biding its moment. No, he was not free
from the chains of his difficulties. His competitors—he
thought of them as enemies—were as yet strong,
untouched, unready for peace. They were capable
of striking, would strike if a telling blow could be
launched. There was Michael Moran.</p>

<p>The task of defending his own was just begun;
the feat of bringing his enemies to overtures of
peace was distant from accomplishment; and again
there was Michael Moran. It was Jim’s first contact
with that black spirit called hatred. He hated
Michael Moran because it was inevitable he should
do so, because Michael Moran was the exponent of
all things at the remotest pole from Jim’s ideals.</p>

<p>With something like consternation he admitted to
himself that he hated Michael Moran because the
man’s life orbit had touched with pitch the life of a
woman who had assumed preponderating importance
in Jim’s universe.</p>

<p>As he alighted from the train at Diversity he saw
Marie Ducharme as he had first seen her weeks ago.
She stood motionless, a statue with lines of loveliness
surmounted by a face of hopeless discontent. In her
eyes was the look of hunger, like that of the starving
woman in the bread-line. She gazed after the departing
train as one might gaze after a hope dispelled.</p>

<p>Jim walked toward her. She saw him and nodded
coolly.</p>

<p>“School’s out early,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s Saturday,” she replied, shortly.</p>

<p>She turned away from the depot, no cordiality in
her manner, but Jim was not to be rebuffed. He kept
at her side.</p>

<p>“Since I have been here,” he said, “I have never
driven out along the lake shore. They tell me it is a
beautiful drive.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, without interest.</p>

<p>“The train was warm, the dust got into my
throat. Seems as if I were filled with it. All the
way I kept thinking of expanses of clean water and
of breezes off the lake. Won’t you extend our truce
to a drive out there with me this evening?”</p>

<p>She turned to him with a queer, abrupt, birdlike,
startled movement. There was no pretense about it,
she was surprised, jolted so that one peeped for an instant
through her mask of sullenness to the loneliness,
the yearning within. The crack closed instantly.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask me?” she demanded. “You
don’t like me.”</p>

<p>“I asked you because I want very much to have
you go. And I do not dislike you.”</p>

<p>“Everybody does.”</p>

<p>“I can’t speak for everybody, but I doubt it.
You—you have a way of shouldering folks off, of
retiring behind the barbed wire. Folks would be
willing enough to like you if you’d let them.”</p>

<p>She pondered this and shook her head slightly.</p>

<p>“Part of what you say is true. There aren’t many
people here I want to like me. Haven’t you lived
here long enough to see that the people who stay
here are the culls, the weak ones? Is there a young
man or a young woman here with gumption? Just
as soon as a boy amounts to a row of pins, gets an
education or has ambition, he goes away. It is the
same with the girls. The desirable go, the other
sort stay. This is a backwater of life with nothing
in it but human driftwood.”</p>

<p>Jim appreciated the insight of her words. She
spoke with some exaggeration, but with more
sound truth. Her words might be a true arraignment
of the average small town, secluded, with insufficient
outlet or inlet. They might apply to a
thousand villages in Michigan, in Vermont, in New
York, in Tennessee. He understood her better than
ever before—indeed, here was his first step in
comprehension.</p>

<p>“You’re lonesome,” he said, more to himself than
to her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, simply. “Lonesome—and bored,
horribly bored.”</p>

<p>“I am lonesome, too. Lonesome, but not bored.
I have too much on my mind to be bored, which is
better for me, probably. So won’t you mend my
lonesomeness for one evening by driving with me?”</p>

<p>“If you will say on your honor that you want me
to,” she said.</p>

<p>Jim listened for a note of wistfulness in her voice;
fancied he distinguished it; was not certain he did.</p>

<p>“On my honor,” he said, half-laughingly, “I do
want you.” Then, “Might we not ask Mrs. Stickney
to put up a lunch for us and start right away?”</p>

<p>Again she looked at him, for there had been a note
of boyish eagerness in his voice, and she smiled a very
little. The smile was a revelation; while it lasted
her face was not the face of a discontented woman,
versed in the unpleasant things of the world, but of a
girl, an eager, wistful girl.</p>

<p>“I should like it,” she said.</p>

<p>How was Jim to know this was an event in Marie
Ducharme’s life? How was he to know it was her
first social invitation from a man whom she cared to
have as a companion, who was fitted by intelligence,
by ideals, to be her companion? How was he to
know that she had never driven with a young man
as other country girls drive with neighboring boys?
She was excited. Something welled up inside her
that made breathing difficult, but that was delightful.</p>

<p>Jim, too, was young. His experience had not
taught him how hard is the problem of the girl in
the village—how marriage looms before her as the
sole end to be desired, and how difficult is a suitable
marriage to attain. He did not know how many girls
with brains, with ideals, with ambitions, have, to
escape spinsterhood and its dreariness, allowed themselves
to be married to bumpkins, whose sole recommendation
was their ability to provide support.
Nor did he know how many such girls wore out their
souls and their hearts in bitterness through lengthening
years. Such a fate Marie Ducharme was determined
to escape.</p>

<h1 id='t5387'>CHAPTER XV</h1>

<p>Jim and Marie Ducharme took the north road
out of Diversity. There were eyes that saw
them and tongues that wagged when they were gone.
Many supper-tables were supplied with a topic of
conversation that had been barren without.</p>

<p>“Some day,” said Jim, “I’m going to have a farm,
and raise red pigs and black cows and white chickens.”</p>

<p>“Horrors!” exclaimed Marie; but there was just
a note of playfulness in her voice, the first Jim ever
had heard there. “Some day I’m going to have an
apartment in a hotel, where there’s a Hungarian
orchestra at dinner, and servants to answer pushbuttons,
and taxicabs in front that take you to
theaters. And I’m going to raise—well, not pigs and
cows and chickens.”</p>

<p>“I shall come in off my farm twice a year to eat
with you while the orchestra plays and the pushbuttons
buzz and the taxicabs click off exorbitant
miles on their meters as we go to those theaters.
Pigs and cows and chickens wear, they’re durable
company; the other thing is too heady for me. Like
champagne once in a while. But one prefers water
as a steady diet.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only read about champagne,” she said, the
sullen mask dropping across her face for an instant.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have my farm near the lake,”
he said, “so I can lie with my back against a tree
and watch it. It is a hundred different lakes every
day, and I’d like to get acquainted with all of them.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to be aboard the most palatial
steamer that floats, and ride past you, on my way
to great cities.”</p>

<p>“I’d be happiest,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’d be—most excited,” she replied.</p>

<p>“The most pitifully bored faces in the world are
to be seen in Broadway cafes after midnight.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you like to be where things are flashing?
Where life is moving so fast you can hardly
follow it? Doesn’t it spell happiness for you to be
where a new thrill is always at hand for the asking?”</p>

<p>“That sort of thing is bully for dessert, but I
want it after a long, satisfying meal of quiet contentment.”</p>

<p>“Such as you have in Diversity?”</p>

<p>“Such as can be had in Diversity,” he replied.</p>

<p>“What makes contentment? I should like to have
it.”</p>

<p>“Contentment,” he said, slowly, selecting his
words cautiously, “means to me the quiet feeling
of decency and satisfaction and restfulness that comes
to a man who is busy with a worth-while job. To
have it fully there must be a home, a real home
with a wife in it, and lads, and a dog and cat. All
of them must be glad to see you come home at night,
and sorry to see you leave in the morning. To
have it your wife must believe in you more than
you deserve, and you must trust her, and confide in
her, and advise with her on all your concerns, sure
of her interest. Yes, I think that is the indispensable
element—marriage. The right sort of marriage—the
sort the majority of folks are blessed with.”</p>

<p>“It all sounds rather tame,” she said. “Marriage.
Must I marry to be contented?”</p>

<p>“To be so perfectly.”</p>

<p>She laughed shortly. “I shall depend on a steady
routine of excitement to make me forget I’m not
contented,” she said. “Marriage!” She spoke almost
savagely. “Of course marriage is the solution
of everything. Women are taught to look forward
to it from the cradle as—as their means of support.
We’re trained to please men; we’re dressed to attract
men; our whole lives are aimed at men. We catch
one at twenty or at twenty-five, and our career is over.
We’ve succeeded in life. Then we live on till sixty.”</p>

<p>“You’ve read only the introduction to the story,”
he said, soberly. “The book doesn’t begin to get
interesting until you pass that.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. I must marry to be contented.
But whom? Diversity isn’t swarming with husbands
of any sort. Among the few available male inhabitants,
how many would you pick out as welcome husbands
for a girl with ambitions above turnips and
the number of eggs a day? If you were a girl, with
reasonable intelligence, reasonable capabilities to appreciate
what we consider it cultured to appreciate,
what man here would you pick out from Diversity’s
young men who wouldn’t be a constant horror to
you?”</p>

<p>“You’re not limited to Diversity.”</p>

<p>“But that is exactly what I am.”</p>

<p>There was no obvious answer to this, and Jim
drove on in silence. He sensed something of the
girl’s position; appreciated, as he had not before appreciated,
the feeling almost of despair that came over
her as she looked into the future and found it gray,
without gleaming lights or frightening shadows. She
was a bird imprisoned among frogs.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a little bridge over a
stream which added its little flow to the volume of
the lake. It was one of those reed-bordered streams
which travel with a soothing lilt, winding along
leisurely, contentedly.</p>

<p>It was not such a boisterous stream as the speckled
trout loves; it was the sort where tiny turtles sun
themselves on root or log, to slide off with a startled
splash as you approach. Cows would have loved
to wade in it of a hot day.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather be a stream like that,”
Jim asked, “than to go plunging and leaping and
bruising yourself down the rocks of a mountainside?”</p>

<p>She smiled, but did not answer. The picture had
soothed her; it lay gently on her spirit, softening her
mood.</p>

<p>“There’s a cat-boat,” Jim exclaimed. “Wonder if
we can’t borrow it. It’ll be just a cat-boat to me,
but you can turn it into your palatial steamer, if you
want to. Shall we try?”</p>

<p>“I’d love it,” she said. “I have never sailed.”</p>

<p>Never sailed! Yet she had spent her whole life
in sight of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Jim, “you’ll sail now if I have to
turn pirate and steal us a craft.”</p>

<p>But the transaction went smoothly. The little
boat was rented, the horse unharnessed and stabled;
they embarked their provisions, and with a brisk
sailing breeze headed out for distant, invisible
Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Jim handled sheet and tiller; Marie half reclined
at his side. And because she was happy, for the
hour she seemed beautiful to him—she was beautiful.
Jim felt the force of her, not exerted in futile rebellion,
wasted, but to be reclaimed by a wise hand and
directed to the great work which falls to the lot of all
good women. He saw her superior in mind to the
women he knew; quickened by ambition. He saw
her as she might be, indeed as she was at the moment.
Her appeal was powerful. He compared her with
women he had known; she made them seem faded,
colorless. He glanced at her; his glance became
a scrutiny of which she was unconscious. She
seemed very desirable to him. It came over him
suddenly that he must have her; that she was the
necessary woman. It was as if he had known it
always.</p>

<p>It was Sudden Jim who spoke.</p>

<p>“Marie,” he said, and at the sound of his voice,
the tremor in it, she turned, startled. “Marie,” he
repeated. No other word came for a moment, but
his face, his eyes, were eloquent. The color left her
face, left her lips first. “Marie, won’t you be a part
of that contentment? Won’t you help me to it—and
let me help you to it? I want you. I—love
you, Marie. I want the right to love you always—and
to take care of you and make you happy. I
want you to love me.”</p>

<p>She sat stiffly erect, unbelief in her eyes. Her hands
gripped each other in her lap. She was amazed;
not frightened, but something akin to it.</p>

<p>“I want you to let me try to make you smile,
always, as you have smiled once to-day. I want to
make the world sing for you, so that you will love
the world, too. I want to take that look, that
hunger look, out of your eyes forever, and put something
else in its place. I want every act of mine, as
long as I shall live, to add something to your happiness.
You! You! Just you!” He held the sheet
and tiller with one hand, stretched the other to
touch her fingers gently.</p>

<p>“Marie, can’t you—won’t you—take me into your
life? Will you marry me—very soon?”</p>

<p>“Marry you!” she said, in a whisper.</p>

<p>She looked about her as if searching for a way of
escape. Then she stood up abruptly and ran forward
to the very peak of the little craft, and crouched
there on her knees, her chin in her hands, her eyes
closed, or opening to peer off across the reaches of
the lake. Jim could see her shiver now and again as
though a chill wind blew over her. She did not
speak.</p>

<p>After a time he called to her.</p>

<p>“Marie, I did not mean to frighten you. I—I
was abrupt—”</p>

<p>“You did not frighten me,” she said.</p>

<p>He plucked up heart. “I can’t come to you,”
he said, yearningly. “I can’t talk to you so far
away. Won’t you come back to me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Not now,” she said. “I—Oh,
let me think. Let me be quiet.”</p>

<p>He was patient. That much wisdom was given
him in this hour. It grew dusk. Jim could only
see the dark huddle of her body beyond the mast.
It stirred. She was at his side again.</p>

<p>“You don’t love me. You can’t love me. I am
not lovable, I know.”</p>

<p>“Your word shall be my law—except for this one
time. I do love you.”</p>

<p>“No! No! It is pity, sympathy, something.
I told you once what love would be if it came to
me. It would be no gentle thing. It would make
you hate me. You do not want my love.”</p>

<p>“It is the one thing I want.”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t,” she whispered to herself. “I
mustn’t.” Then to Jim: “I don’t love you. You
would repent it if you had made me love you. While
I was up there”—she pointed to the bow—“I thought
of marrying you—to escape from Diversity. Yes, I
thought of that—without love. But it would be no
escape. You are tied to Diversity. It would be
the same as before. I hate Diversity. It smothers
me. If I loved you I wouldn’t marry you. Diversity
would stand between us.”</p>

<p>Jim sat quietly. He had no hope on which to
base expectation of any other answer. How could
she love him? He had not tried to win her love;
had pounced suddenly with talk of love.</p>

<p>“How could you love me?” he said, repeating his
thought. “But won’t you let me work for your
love? I should try to earn it. If love came you
would forget that Diversity was hateful to you.
It would be a garden to you as it is to me—for my
love had blossomed there.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, sharply. “If I worshiped you,
and you asked me to live in that miserable town,
with its miserable people, I should refuse. It would
torture me, but I could not live there.”</p>

<p>“Think,” he urged. “Take time to think. This
has come to you unexpectedly. Wait before you
set your will against my love. Give me my chance.”</p>

<p>“No. You must not speak of it again. I am
only an incident in your life. Set me aside. Forget
this afternoon. You must forget it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t consider? You won’t wait for another
day’s judgment?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Jim turned away his face, turned it away from
her lest the embers of the sunset should show how
gray, how tired, how discouraged it was.</p>

<p>“I—I’m sorry,” she said, softly.</p>

<p>He turned and smiled. “I am glad,” he said.
“Glad I love you, no matter what comes between
now and the end. I shall not worry you again with
it, but I want you to know, to be sure in your heart,
day by day, every hour, that I do love you and am
longing for you. I have spoiled your evening.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “It has been—sweet. So sweet!”</p>

<p>He was startled to see her burst into tears, and sob
with great, wrenching sobs that shook her small body.</p>

<p>Presently she became calm, dried her eyes, smiled,
and her smile was the ghost of a spirit of wistfulness.</p>

<p>“If only,” she said, tremulously, “I were like
other girls. But I’m not. I’m me. I’m selfish. I
despise myself.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said; “don’t remember this with a
thought of pain. And do not withdraw from me
altogether. Let us cancel to-night to start to-morrow
on a new basis—as friends. You are lonely;
I am lonely. I’ll not worry you with love. But
I’ll try to be a dependable friend to you. Can we
do that?”</p>

<p>“It sounds impossible,” she said, “but we can
try.”</p>

<p>Love finds encouragement in trifles. The weight
of Jim’s heaviness became less. He hoped. If
Pandora had not loosed hope into the world the
lovers’ portion would be miserable indeed.</p>

<p>It was late when they reached the Widow Stickney’s,
but she was waiting for them in her parlor.
Her old eyes with their years of seeing were not to be
deceived. She saw what she saw.</p>

<p>Marie went quickly to her room. They said good
night at the foot of the stairs. Jim extended his
hand, held her little one in his grasp.</p>

<p>“Good night, friend,” he said, and smiled into her
face.</p>

<p>She sat beside her window without undressing,
motionless, even her eyes seeming without motion.
She was wrestling, even as Jacob had wrestled, with
an angel. But her angel had no divine touch of the
finger to conquer her as the patriarch had been
conquered.</p>

<p>The angel met defeat.</p>

<p>Marie lay face downward on the bed, tearless,
passing through the agony she had brought on
herself.</p>

<p>“I love him,” she whispered. “I love him. But
I can’t. I can’t.”</p>

<h1 id='t5750'>CHAPTER XVI</h1>

<p>Between the fall of darkness Sunday night
and the breaking of dawn on Monday industrious
persons had beautified Diversity by nailing
to tree, fence, and barn half-tone productions of a
photograph of Peleg Goodwin, wherein Peleg was
shown wearing a collar of the Daniel Webster type
and an expression like a slightly soured Signer of the
Declaration. Peleg’s beard was neatly trimmed;
there was a part in his bushy hair. Somehow it did
not impress one as authentic, but as a bit of trick
photography. It excited some argument. People
were disinclined to believe it really was Peleg, but
some more glorious being who chanced to resemble
Peleg somewhat.</p>

<p>“That there Peleg!” snorted Dolf Springer. “You
couldn’t pound Peleg’s face into no such noble expression
with a sledge. That there’s Peleg’s twin
brother that died and went to heaven ’fore Peleg
got him into bad habits.”</p>

<p>“If that’s Peleg,” said old man Ruggles in a
voice like a wheezy tin whistle, “then these here blue
jeans is broadcloth weddin’-pants.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see but what it resembles him close,”
said a supporter of Goodwin’s.</p>

<p>“That,” said Dolf, “is prob’ly ’cause somebody’s
give you a dollar to think that way.”</p>

<p>“My vote hain’t for sale,” shouted the virtuous
citizen.</p>

<p>“Neither does a mortgage draw int’rest,” said
Dolf.</p>

<p>Jim drove on, chuckling. One thing was apparent—somebody
was spending money to defeat
Zaanan Frame. It was not all going for printing,
either, Jim felt certain. How would Zaanan meet
this attack? Had he money to spend in a campaign?
A worry lest the old fellow had passed his
fighting-day oppressed Jim. He stopped at Zaanan’s
office.</p>

<p>“I see the campaign has opened,” he said.</p>

<p>“Peleg’s a handsome critter, hain’t he?” Zaanan
said.</p>

<p>“Moran’s going to dump a lot of money and a lot
of dirty politics in here,” Jim said. “What are you
going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Me? Not much, I calc’late. I hain’t what
you’d call a political campaigner. Don’t go in for
no hip-hurrah just ’round election-time. Keep
reasonable busy the whole twelve months.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to do anything to offset Moran’s
money?”</p>

<p>“Dun’no’s I be,” said Zaanan, placidly.</p>

<p>“They’ll beat you in the caucus as sure as you’re
a foot high,” Jim said, anxiously. “They’ve got to
do it there. I don’t believe they could worry you
in an election.”</p>

<p>“Caucuses is uncertain,” said Zaanan. “Delegates
and sheep is close related. Can’t never tell
when or where they’ll run.”</p>

<p>“Do you need money?” Jim asked, a shade diffidently.
“I thought if you did—”</p>

<p>“Young feller, if I had a million dollars I wouldn’t
spend a cent. If folks elect me to office it’ll be
’cause they want me, and not ’cause they’re paid to
vote for me. But I calc’late I’m obleeged to you.
It was a right friendly offer.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Zaanan, with a chuckle; “go ’long
and tend to your own business. Git your own
neck out of the noose ’fore you reach out to help
me over a fence. G’-by, Jim.”</p>

<p>When Jim got to the mill he found Grierson ready
with his weekly report. The old bookkeeper had
put in a happy Sunday preparing it. From morning
till night he had scratched and crackled in figures
and computations—a regular debauch.</p>

<p>“She’s coming. She’s coming now,” Grierson said,
his face wrinkling dryly as if the skin were ledger
paper. “Shows sixty-five boxes to the machine.”</p>

<p>“But shipments are less than ever,” Jim said as
he glanced over the sheet.</p>

<p>“Cars,” said Grierson, shortly. “Goods are in
the warehouse, but the railroad won’t set in cars
to ship them out.”</p>

<p>Moran’s railroad would not set in cars. This was
not altogether unexpected. The railroad could
hamper him, delay him—and escape under the plea
of a car shortage. Crops were moving. The excuse
would hold good. Jim knew he was powerless
against this new aggression.</p>

<p>Then came a telegram from New York, driving
temporarily from Jim’s mind the matter of freight-cars.
It was a long telegram:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>German steamer <span class='it'>Dessau</span> sunk 50,000 boxes pins aboard,
bound Bremen to Argentine. Agents Argentine firms offer
70 cents on dock here. Have order 15,000 boxes if can ship
ten days. Money on dock. Welliver fill order you cannot.</p>

</div>

<p>Seventy cents for pins with the New York market
at forty-four cents or thereabouts! A clean killing
of nearly fifty-five hundred dollars!</p>

<p>Jim snatched up Grierson’s report. It showed
seven thousand boxes packed in the warehouse, and
estimated twelve thousand boxes unpacked in the
bins. He did not wait to weigh consequences or to
offset difficulties.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Accept order. Will ship 15,000 boxes pins ten days this
date seventy cents New York.</p>

</div>

<p>This message despatched, Jim rushed out into the
mill in search of Beam; told him the fact.</p>

<p>“How will we get them packed out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If you was to ask me serious,” said Beam, with
a frown, “I’d say you couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to. How many are we packing out a
day?”</p>

<p>“Close to a thousand boxes. These packers are
the limit. They can’t get up speed.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make some regular shipments.
That means about fifteen thousand boxes to pack
out in ten days. Put on a double force of packers.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll I git ’em? We’re short now, and no
place to go for more.”</p>

<p>“Get boys, then,” said Jim. “And tell the men—any
of them that are willing to work evenings—to
come in and pack. We’ll run that packing-room
twenty-four hours a day if we have to.”</p>

<p>“You’re the boss,” said Beam, dubiously.</p>

<p>Jim went in person to the freight department of the
railroad. He made requisition for eight extra cars
to be set in within ten days.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” said the freight-agent. “We
haven’t and won’t have the cars.”</p>

<p>“You mean you have orders not to set in cars for
us, don’t you? Well, Mister Freight-Agent, I’m
going to have those cars. You see to it they’re
set in or things’ll happen round here.”</p>

<p>“You can’t bulldoze me,” said the man. “I
know what I’m doin’. You’ll get what cars I set
in, and no more. And if you talk too much maybe
you won’t get any.”</p>

<p>Jim glared at the man, half of a mind to haul him
over the desk and argue with him physically, but
thought better of it and slammed out of the office.
He had to have those cars. It was equally clear
the road would not give them to him. What then?</p>

<p>To reach the office again Jim had to pass through
the yard where dry lumber for turned stock was
piled. There was, he noticed, a reasonable supply,
but no heavy stock. More would have to be
bought within the month, for his own sawmill had
not yet been able to cut out for drying sufficient
quantities to carry on operations. Drying, air-drying,
requires time. Until his own boards could
dry, lumber must be purchased. Thence came the
idea.</p>

<p>He hurried to the office and sent wires to Muskegon,
to Traverse City, to Reed City, to the big
lumber-mills of the section.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>How much two-inch stock can you ship at once. Must
come box-cars. Price.</p>

</div>

<p>In two hours he had replies, irritated, humorous,
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Box-cars? Are you crazy?” one said. Jim
grinned. He knew it must sound like lunacy to be
ordering lumber of the class he wanted in box-cars.
He replied to all, reiterating his demands.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents extra per thousand for loading,”
came back replies.</p>

<p>“How many cars?” Jim countered. “When?”</p>

<p>Muskegon could ship two cars next day and one
the day after. Traverse could ship three cars within
three days. Reed City could ship four, on four successive
days.</p>

<p>“O. K.,” wired Jim. “Let them come hustling.”</p>

<p>He had solved his car problem. Moran’s road
could not stop cars shipped through. They would
be set in on Jim’s siding and unloaded, and because
Jim had requisitions in for cars as yet unsupplied,
he could reload them and ship them out again filled
with his product.</p>

<p>He called in Grierson.</p>

<p>“I’ve accepted an order for fifteen thousand pins
for Argentine Republic. Price seventy cents New
York. To be shipped in ten days.”</p>

<p>Grierson threw up his hands. “We haven’t the
pins. We can’t get the cars to ship them.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the pins, and the cars are on their
way to us. Send your young man out after Beam.”</p>

<p>The superintendent came in presently.</p>

<p>“I’ve got ten box-cars of two-inch maple and birch
coming in within the next three or four days. Have
a gang ready to take care of it. Put on enough
extra men in the shipping department to load as
fast as the cars empty,” he said.</p>

<p>Beam gaped at Jim. Then his eyes brightened, he
grinned, he threw back his head and roared.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe,” he said, when he could speak,
“you’re a regular feller, and sudden!”</p>

<p>The cars arrived. On the eighth day fifteen
thousand boxes of pins were on their way to New
York in eight box-cars, and the freight-agent of
Moran’s railroad looked at Jim with the light of
admiration in his eyes. Jim had met a sudden
emergency suddenly and efficiently. He was tempted
to sit down and describe the feat to his father, who
would have delighted in it. But he did not. He
remembered Clothespin Jimmy’s admonition not to
bother him with his business.</p>

<p>But Clothespin Jimmy learned of the matter,
which Jim did not know. He learned of it promptly,
as he learned most of the details of what went on in
the mill, from a source Jim was far from suspecting.</p>

<p>The day after the last car was on its way Zaanan
Frame stopped Jim on the street.</p>

<p>“Hain’t forgot that strip of timber of old Le
Bar’s?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Nice afternoon for a drive,” said Zaanan, “out
toward Le Bar’s.”</p>

<p>“Very,” said Jim, smiling at the old man’s manner
of handling a situation. “Would you like to go
with me?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Zaanan, gruffly, “but if I was drivin’
that way and come to Bullet’s Corners and there
wa’n’t nobody there, I calc’late I’d slack down and
wait till somebody come. G’-by, Jim.”</p>

<p>After dinner Jim drove out toward Le Bar’s. At
Bullet’s Corners, waiting in the shade of a big
hickory, were Zaanan Frame and his horse Tiffany.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” said Zaanan. “Goin’ somewheres?”</p>

<p>“Thought I’d call on old man Le Bar,” said Jim,
playing the game according to Zaanan’s rules.</p>

<p>“Goin’ that way myself,” said Zaanan, with surprise
that seemed real. “Calc’late I’ll git there
’bout a quarter of an hour first, seem’s I’ve got the
best horse.”</p>

<p>“You have a fine animal,” said Jim, without a
quiver.</p>

<p>Zaanan looked over at him suspiciously; gazed at
Tiffany’s ancient and knobby frame; opened his
mouth as though to make an observation, but decided
on silence.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Jim,” he said, in a moment.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Judge,” said Jim.</p>

<p>In an honest fifteen minutes Jim drove on until
he saw two old men sitting on the door-step of a house
at the roadside. It was a little, weather-beaten
house, not such as one would expect to find the
owner of a fortune in timber housed in. But one
of the men was Zaanan Frame, so Jim stopped and
alighted.</p>

<p>“Jim,” said Zaanan, “meet Mr. Le Bar. This
here’s Mr. Ashe, Louis.”</p>

<p>“She’s yo’ng man,” said Louis, with a twinkle.</p>

<p>“Mr. Le Bar figgers he’s gittin’ on in life,” said
Zaanan. “He sort of wants to git his affairs settled
up on account of maybe bein’ called away sudden—”</p>

<p>“When le bon Dieu say,” Louis interjected,
softly.</p>

<p>“He owns quite a piece of timber,” said Zaanan,
“and figgered you might have some use for it.
Hardwood.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim, not knowing what was expected
of him. “How many acres?”</p>

<p>“Twenty t’ousand-odd acre,” said Louis.</p>

<p>“It’ll run twenty to twenty-five thousand beech,
birch, and maple to the acre,” said Zaanan.</p>

<p>“Diversity Hardwood Company dey hoffer me
twelf dollar an acre,” said Louis. “But me, I
not sell to heem for twenty. I sell not at all till
comes dat time w’en I’m ready. Now dat time she’s
come.”</p>

<p>“How much are you asking?”</p>

<p>“First price—twelf dollar and a half; last price—twelf
dollar and a half. No dicker.”</p>

<p>Jim looked at Zaanan, who nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a sixty-day option at that price, if
you’re agreeable.”</p>

<p>“How much for dat option?”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Ver’ good. We make trade, eh? Now Zaanan
she write for us a paper.”</p>

<p>Zaanan completed the legal details; they smoked
and ate of Louis’s honey and doughnuts, and started
on the return to Diversity.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,” Jim
said to Zaanan as their buggies came abreast on a
broad stretch of road. “It’s a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“Um! I’ve knowed fellers to do a lot with an
option down to Grand Rapids.”</p>

<p>“What ought I to get for this land?”</p>

<p>“Some folks might go as high as thirteen dollars.
But if they was apt to lose it I shouldn’t be s’prised
if this Diversity Hardwood Company was to go
fifteen. It’s wuth it to them—or anybody else.
But I calc’late I’d git a bonyfidy offer from some
other feller ’fore I went to Moran’s crowd.”</p>

<p>“I calculate so, too,” said Jim. Then after a
pause: “Why didn’t you go into this yourself.
Judge? You could have handled it.”</p>

<p>“Young feller, I’m past seventy. I got enough
so’s nobody kin starve me. I hain’t chick nor
child nor relative on earth. What d’you calc’late
I’d do with more ’n I’ve got? It’s come too late
for me, Jim. I’ve sort of give up my aims and
ambitions for Diversity, and hain’t got none left.
Diversity’s used me up, sich as I be, and it’s welcome
to what it got. And me, I guess I got my pay
all right. I’ve seen marryin’s and christenin’s.
I’ve seen young folks happy and old folks comforted.
I’ve stuck my finger into folkses’ pies, and seen
’em with tears in their eyes that was better ’n thanks.
No, son, I’ve had my investment and my profits.
You’re welcome to yourn.”</p>

<h1 id='t6179'>CHAPTER XVII</h1>

<p>It was the following Friday that Jim’s attention
was called to the scant stock of logs on the skids.
He knew that the mill had been eating up more timber
than before, and of course was pleased, for
that meant an increased production. He knew, too,
that the Diversity Hardwood Company had missed
sending down a train of logs once or twice when
they should have been sent; but other matters had
filled his attention to the exclusion of this.</p>

<p>John Beam saw Jim staring at the logs and
stepped over to his side.</p>

<p>“I was comin’ up to see you about this to-day,”
he said. “Them folks is givin’ us the worst of it,
plenty. Look at the logs they’re sendin’ down.
Mostly beech, and dozy at that. For a week we’ve
been short of maple for veneer. And they’ve
been holdin’ back on us. We’re usin’ twice what
they’re sendin’ down. I asked the boss of their
train crew what was the matter, and he just grinned
at me so’s I wanted to land him one, and says we
was lucky to be alive.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’re trying to tie us up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t <span class='it'>think</span> it,” said John.</p>

<p>Jim turned on his heel and strode back to the
office. He called the Diversity Company on the
telephone.</p>

<p>“We’re running short of logs,” he said. “You’ve
been cutting down on shipments. When can we
have another train-load?”</p>

<p>“Things aren’t going just right in the woods,”
said a voice. “I don’t believe we can get you
more than a small train-load before Tuesday or
Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be shut down Saturday if we don’t get
logs.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Ashe, but we’re doing our best.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Moran there?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be in on the afternoon train.”</p>

<p>Jim hung up the receiver. He had been feeling
too fine; he had grown cocky at his recent successes;
now he had a taste of the opposite emotion. His
mill was running better—but what good did it do if
the log supply failed? He had been able to borrow
money to pay bills and to operate—but that only
made matters worse if he were unable to get out his
product. He had an option on Le Bar’s timber.
This might or might not be a profitable matter, but
it was of no present help. He must have logs.</p>

<p>That afternoon he was at the depot as the train
pulled in. Moran alighted and Jim fastened upon
him instantly. “Mr. Moran,” he said, “your men
are not getting logs to us.”</p>

<p>“Um! What seems to be wrong?” Moran’s
voice was irritating. Jim fancied it was deliberately
irritating.</p>

<p>“I’m not here to tell you what’s wrong. That’s
your lookout,” Jim said. “Your business is to supply
us with logs according to our contract—and if
anything interferes it’s your job to see it doesn’t
interfere.”</p>

<p>Moran’s eyes glinted.</p>

<p>“You’ll get logs as we’re able to ship them. Our
first business is to supply our own mill. You’re a
side issue.”</p>

<p>“That’s your attitude, is it? The obligation of
contract means very little to you.”</p>

<p>“That contract was none of my making, Ashe.
And if you don’t like the way we carry it out, you
have your redress. Go to the courts.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve smoked out the reason we aren’t
getting what we’re entitled to,” said Jim, his voice
rising with his anger. “Its name is Moran—a pretty
unsavory reason, from all I gather.”</p>

<p>Moran glared.</p>

<p>“You can’t talk to me like that, young man.
You can’t bulldoze me.” He started to move away.
Jim reached out swiftly, caught the man by the
shoulder, and slammed him against the side of the
depot.</p>

<p>“I’m not through talking with you,” he said,
evenly, his eyes beginning to glow. “When I want
to talk to a man I don’t consider it good manners
for him to walk off. Now, Mister Man, you stay
put till I’ve mentioned a few things to you. If
you budge I’ll fetch you back again.”</p>

<p>Moran struggled, cursed, and struck at Jim.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to thrash you, Moran,” said Jim,
“but I can—and I may have to. It depends on you.
Stand still!”</p>

<p>Moran turned his savage eyes on the young man’s
face. What he saw made him hesitate. He ceased
to struggle; stood glaring venomously.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” said Jim, unconscious of the knot
of Diversity’s citizens who had gathered about.
“You’ve been needing to hear a few facts and
opinions, and to-day’s the date of delivery. You
and your railroad have been a blight on this county.
You’re trying to turn the Diversity Company into
another blight. So far as I can learn you haven’t
a decent hair on your head. You’re never guilty of
a fair and decent act if hard work will show you a
crooked way out of it. You’ve gouged citizens and
shippers with your railroad; you’ve robbed your
laborers in the woods. If you have any associates
I expect you’ve cheated them.</p>

<p>“Now you’re trying to grab all Diversity and run
it as you run your business. You’re trying to steal a
well-governed, honest town, and turn it into the
sort of thing you admire. You came to me and
asked me to help you. You want to make this
county a little principality, with you as the autocrat.
It would be a sad day for Diversity. If the people
of this town have the sense the Almighty gave
doodle-bugs they’ll see what you’re up to. You
want the courts. You want the machinery of the
law, so you can sack the place. Not a man here,
not a man in your woods, would be safe in life or
property. You could wrong without fear of redress.
So far you’ve been able to get away with it, but
I’m thinking the folks here will wake up in time.
If you’ve been a crook with men you’ve been a
miserable brute with women.”</p>

<p>Moran cursed again, but Jim quelled his struggle
promptly.</p>

<p>“It’s astonishing,” he went on, “that some
woman’s brother or father hasn’t seen to it you got
what you deserve. Some day one of them will.”</p>

<p>Jim was surprised into a moment’s silence by the
sudden grayness that shaded Moran’s face, by the
expression of furtiveness, of fear, that crept into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a bit afraid of that, eh? You ought to
be. Now for personal matters. You think the
Ashe Clothespin Company would be a fine property
to add to your holdings, so you mixed up with
Welliver and his gang to break me. You hired the
Kowterskis to spike my logs and to tamper with my
machinery, and you saw what happened to one
Kowterski. You’ve tried to hold back cars so I
couldn’t ship; now you’re planning to cut me off on
timber. Well, you aren’t going to do it.” He
thought of Marie Ducharme. “And there’s another
matter, which we won’t discuss publicly. If
you think hard perhaps you’ll guess. That’s what
made me despise you first. I don’t suppose it
matters to you how many decent folks despise you,
Moran, but it gives me some satisfaction to tell you
there are a lot of them. I guess that’s about all,
except that I’ve got to have logs—and I’m going to
have them.” He loosened his hold. Moran moved
his head in his released collar, drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Through, are you? Well, Ashe, see if you’re man
enough to listen to me without using the strong arm.
You’ve made your talk. Maybe you think you can
talk that way to Michael Moran and get away with
it. I’ve a few things to settle with you, and this
isn’t the least.” His partially restrained passion
burst its bonds in fury. “I’ll get you!” he shouted.
“I’ll bust you if it takes every dollar I own. Logs!
See how many logs you get. Where’ll you be by the
time the courts give you damages—and by that
time the courts will belong to me. You’ve started in
to crowd me, too, you infernal fool. What good do
you think that Le Bar option is going to do you?
Do you think I’ll buy from you? Don’t you suppose
I can stop a sale to anybody else? You just
lose your thousand, that’s all. And that last thing
that you didn’t describe. I know what it is, Ashe,
and take a warning from me. Change your boarding-house
and get out of my way.” He turned,
pushed his way violently through the little crowd,
and almost ran down the street.</p>

<p>As Jim followed more slowly he heard a man say:
“Gosh! I wouldn’t be him for consid’able. Wait
till Moran gits at him.”</p>

<p>Jim rather longed for that moment. He went at
once to Grierson’s desk.</p>

<p>“Where’s our log contract?” he asked.
Grierson got it from the safe. Jim jerked it open,
read it quickly. His eyes lighted, his teeth clicked.
“Listen to this,” he said. “Does it mean what
it says—legally? ‘If for any reason the said Diversity
Hardwood Company shall fail to deliver to
the said Ashe Clothespin Company logs according
to the terms of this contract in sufficient number to
fill the requirements of the said Ashe Clothespin
Company, then the said Clothespin Company shall
have the right to go upon the lands of the Hardwood
Company at the most convenient place to them, and
to cut timber, take logs from skidways, make use
of all tools and appliances belonging to the Hardwood
Company which shall be necessary to such
logging operations, and this shall include the use of
camps, railroads, teams, tools, and any equipment
which is available. The cost of such operations shall
be faithfully noted and shall be deducted from the
contract price of the timber taken in such manner.’”</p>

<p>Grierson peered at Jim through his glasses. “It’s
a usual clause in such contracts,” he said, “and I
guess it’s legal. But that’s as strong a clause as I
ever saw. I don’t know as I ever heard of one that
was enforced.”</p>

<p>“This one is going to be,” said Jim, shortly.
“Go out to the log-yard,” he said to Grierson’s
assistant, “and send Tim Bennett here.”</p>

<p>“Tim,” said Jim, when the cant-dog man appeared,
“there was a time when lumberjacks would
fight for their boss.”</p>

<p>“Who says I won’t?” Tim demanded, belligerently.</p>

<p>“Just wanted to find out,” said Jim, with a smile
that Tim answered broadly. “Know where there
are any more like you?”</p>

<p>“Lumberjacks—real ones—is leavin’ this county
as fast as they kin go. But there’s some left.
Shouldn’t be s’prised if I could dig up a couple of
dozen.”</p>

<p>“I want clean men—no boozers—on duty. I
want men to depend on in a pinch, who will keep
their mouths shut. And I’d just as soon they
wouldn’t be friends of Michael Moran.”</p>

<p>“Mike Moran, is it?” Tim asked, his eyes gleaming.
“Are you goin’ after him? ’Tis a glad day for
Tim Bennett. Friends of Mike’s—there hain’t no
sich animal, Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>“Find all you can. Don’t tell ’em what’s up—because
you don’t know,” Jim said, with a twinkle.
“Don’t get ’em together in a gang, but have ’em
meet to-morrow night in that bunch of cedar this
side the red bridge. If they happen to have peavey
handles they might bring them along.”</p>

<p>“To use for canes where the walkin’s bad,”
grinned Tim. “I’ll have them there.”</p>

<p>Jim was not satisfied. He wired a friend in the
old home town:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Go down Patsy’s have him send twenty good boys. Ten on
afternoon, ten on morning train to-morrow. With peavey
handles.</p>

</div>

<p>He knew this would be enough; that Patsy
Garrity would send him the men he needed.</p>

<p>Jim wanted advice, but hesitated to ask it. He
knew Zaanan Frame was his friend, but the old man
was on the side of law and order. He might frown
on Jim’s intention, for, lawful as it was, it might,
probably would, turn out to be anything but orderly
or peaceful. Still, he decided to go.</p>

<p>Zaanan listened to him quietly, let him finish without
comment.</p>

<p>“Blood’s young,” he said at the end, and wagged
his head. “But this time I calc’late there hain’t
no other way. Moran hain’t got no use for law, but
he’ll go rushin’ off for a temp’rary injunction.
That’ll tie you up till he kin collect his army.
If I was doin’ this I calc’late I’d git there first.
Eh? See young Bob Allen that’s runnin’ for prosecutor.
He’ll draw the bill for you. You’re startin’
in on a real job, Jim. Better be reasonable sure
you’re ready to finish it ’fore you start in. G’-by,
Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim went to Bob Allen. The young lawyer’s eyes
shone as he listened.</p>

<p>“It’s coming to him,” he said. “Moran’s been
needing somebody to handle him without tongs.
Mr. Ashe, if I get to be prosecutor, and you’ll back
me, I’ll chase him round in circles. I’ll do it whether
you back me or not. We want to handle this right.
When do you plan to land your invasion?”</p>

<p>“About midnight to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then Judge Scudder’s due to have his rest
broken. I’ll be at his house at midnight with the
papers—and a deputy. He’ll issue the injunction, all
right. By that time you’ll be in full blossom.
The deputy will slide off to serve the restraining
order. Gosh! I’d like to be along with you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have you,” said Jim, heartily. “We’ve
never had time to get acquainted, but I guess we’re
going to. Eh?”</p>

<p>“You bet you!” said Allen. “This place has been
drifting along to the graveyard. It’s a godsend to
have somebody come along that’s sudden. From
what I hear you’re sudden enough to suit anybody—judging
from your little love-feast with Moran this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the citizens are holding a funeral over
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But they’re thinking, too. You mentioned
a few things that gave them something to
think about. I don’t figure you did Peleg Goodwin’s
campaign a heap of good. It’s going to be
a fight, though. Moran’s spending money.”</p>

<p>“The next prosecutor ought to have legal evidence
of it,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Allen exclaimed, “that’s something I
overlooked. If evidence is to be had I’ll get it.”</p>

<p>Jim went back to the office to study a map of the
section and to lay the plans for his campaign.</p>

<h1 id='t6544'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1>

<p>That night Tim Bennett’s lumberjacks began
to drift in. There were Danes, Frenchmen,
Irish, a sprinkling of Indians. They did not linger
in Diversity, nor did they congregate, but passed
quickly through with a cheerful air. There was
exhilaration, anticipation, in their eyes, whether of
Scandinavian blue or of aboriginal black. Old times
were back again. For a moment a decadent age of
which they despaired was returning to better manners,
and there was to be a fight. Peavey handles!
There was joy to be had from the very sound of it.
In the morning a scattering of big men, predominantly
Irish, got off the train and straggled
away. In the afternoon another group arrived.
They came so quietly, so unostentatiously, that
Diversity was hardly aware of them. A full fifty
were on hand—fifty fighting-men such as no other
set of conditions has produced, men who fought and
worked for the joy of it. A race of men who worked,
not for pay, but because they loved the work, is
worthy of chronicle. They live no more. Men
whose highest wage was the knowledge that their
camp or crew, or they individually, had done more
and harder and better work than some other camp
or crew or individual have resident in them something
that should be handed down through time for
other generations to admire. They possessed vices,
but they were brief, flaming, roaring safety-valve
vices, almost epic in themselves. For months they
were accustomed to live austere, laborious, loyal
lives in the ramps. Then for a day, a week, they
appeared among their fellows, and their fellows received
them and robbed them and plied them with
liquor and directed their splendid energies into ways
of debauchery. On the scales of justice the robust
virtue of them outweighs their brief, primitive
descents into the depths. They were men.</p>

<p>Tim Bennett reported to Jim Ashe. “They’re
here, fair bustin’ with the thought of it. The taste
of a fight is in their mouths and they’re rollin’ it
under their tongues.”</p>

<p>“Good men?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe,” said Tim, joyously, “I’d undertake
to drive logs through hell with ’em—and the devil
throwin’ rocks from the shore.”</p>

<p>“Any talk in town?”</p>

<p>“Not a peep. Them boys sneaked through like
the shadow of a flock of hummin’-birds. They’re
keepin’ quiet where they are without even a bit of a
song. By night there’ll be so much deviltry penned
up in ’ere lookin’ for a place to bust out, that when
it does come Moran’ll think a herd of boilers is
blowin’ up round him.”</p>

<p>“Go out, then, and keep them quiet. I’ll be along
by ten to-night.”</p>

<p>It was not Jim’s intention to descend upon the
Diversity Hardwood Company with his men blindly
and to seize what might by good fortune fall into
his hands. He had planned well, as a good general
plans. Simultaneously he would strike at several
points, so that in a single moment, if all went well,
the machinery he needed to move logs would be in
his hands. He was ready.</p>

<p>Satisfied he had done all he could do to make
success certain, Jim went home to the widow’s
to supper. He was excited. Appetite was lacking.
He felt inside very much like a countryman descending
for the first time in a swift elevator. It
was not fear; it was not excitement; it was all the
nerves of his body setting and bracing themselves,
making ready to respond to strain.</p>

<p>He scarcely touched his food; sat silently reviewing
his plans to make sure every point was checked
up, that there would be no omissions, no mistake.
The widow watched him out of the corner of her
shrewd eye; Marie Ducharme watched him, too,
less shrewdly, with a different sort of glance. Marie’s
eyes were dark with much brooding; were circled
by drab shadows drawn by the finger of mental
anguish. If Jim had looked at her he would have
seen again that hungry look with which she followed
the departing train—but now it was bent upon himself.</p>

<p>The widow withdrew to the kitchen, not obviously,
but with sufficient pretext. She sensed a quarrel;
she saw in Jim’s silence and lack of appetite an ailment
of the heart, not a business worry. She fancied
Marie’s face spoke of willingness to be reconciled—and
eliminated herself to give the difficulty a chance
to right itself. Widows have a way of seeing more
love-affairs than are visible to other eyes—more, in
fact, than are in being.</p>

<p>Presently Marie spoke:</p>

<p>“Jim,” she said. It was the first time she had
called him by his first name. “Jim, I want to go
somewhere, do something, to-night. I want to get
away from this house.”</p>

<p>Jim looked at her a moment, and she was hurt to
see he was not thinking of her, had hardly understood
her words. Perhaps she, too, had put on his
silence the same interpretation as the widow.</p>

<p>“Go somewhere?” he said, vaguely, then flushed
at his awkwardness. “I’m sorry, Marie. I was a
long way off when you spoke. It was rude, wasn’t
it? But I’ve had such a heap of things to think
about these last days that some of them insist on
hanging round outside of business hours. Has something
happened? Any trouble with Mrs. Stickney?”</p>

<p>“No. No trouble. I just want to get away. I
want you to talk to me and keep me from thinking
about myself—and some things. I—I’m afraid tonight,
Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim bit his lip boyishly.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he said. “I simply can’t get
away to-night. Business. But don’t I wish I
could go with you some place—and talk to you.
There are things I wanted to say to you the other
night, Marie, that—well, I guess it took time for
me to think of. I want to talk to you about the
same thing, for I’ve been thinking about the same
thing. I was too abrupt. You were right to give
me the answer you did—but I’ve got some more
arguments now, a lot of them.”</p>

<p>Marie’s face softened. How boyish, how eagerly
boyish he was!</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk about that,” she said, gently.
“I can’t change. Your work is here. You’re tied
to it. And I must get away from it—to stay.
Can’t you understand? Don’t misunderstand me,
Jim. It wasn’t to give you a chance to ask me to
reconsider that I asked you to go out with me.
No. No. It was to have you to talk to. To have
the consciousness that I was with a man—a man
who—was—a human being.” Her voice faltered. “I
wanted you to say to me some of the things you have
said before—about people being good, about the
world being good, about faith and trustworthiness
and honor. I don’t know those things, but I want
to hear about them—to-night. Because I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of what?”</p>

<p>“Afraid of—myself. I talked to you that first
day we met—more than I should. So you know me.
I am the same girl I was then, but I am not the
same girl. Then I knew it would be possible for
me to choose the—bitter way. To choose it deliberately
as a way of escape. But I did not know
then how bitter that way would be. Now I know I
should not choose it deliberately, but be forced into
it by—by myself.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk that way, I won’t have you
say that sort of thing about—my girl.”</p>

<p>“It’s true, and I am afraid. Can’t your business
step aside for to-night?”</p>

<p>“It can’t, Marie. If it were an ordinary night or
an ordinary matter that calls me, I would stay.”
He stopped, considered. It was his nature to speak
little of his affairs, to offer few confidences. To
tell Marie the truth seemed his only honorable way
of escape from the dilemma. “I’ll tell you about it,”
he said, with sudden decision, “and you will understand.”</p>

<p>Then he told her, from the beginning in his
father’s library. He described his difficulties, his
war with the Clothespin Club, his bitterer war with
Michael Moran. He told her what Moran had done
and was seeking to do. He told her his measures of
defense and of counter-attack, and particularly the
plan for to-night. “And so you see,” he ended, “I
must go.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, slowly, “you must go. And
Michael Moran has done those things? You must
hate him!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim, “but not for what he has done
to me. I hate him because—” He hesitated, unable
to bring himself to utter the thought in connection
with Marie.</p>

<p>“Because?” Marie questioned.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Jim, between his teeth, “he is
planning and working to make you take the choice
you have talked about without appreciating what
you were saying.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Marie, her eyes shut as though to
hide from her a painful sight—“yes, he is doing that.
And I have known what I was saying, Jim. I know
what I am saying now. I wish you could have
stayed with me to-night, Jim. I’m afraid—afraid.”
She arose and ran from the room.</p>

<p>When Jim left the house it was with a troubled
mind. He did not understand Marie; she was not
fathomable by him. The evening’s zest of adventure
lay cold within him.</p>

<p>Shortly after eight o’clock he drove away from the
livery barn. As he drove past the Widow Stickney’s
street he glanced toward the house and saw
Michael Moran entering the yard. What he did not
see was Marie Ducharme leaving by the back way,
hurrying as though pursued, making her way to the
edge of town and beyond—beyond until she arrived
at the hummock where she and Jim had first spoken.
And there she crouched, looking off to the southwest
where a silver gleam of the great lake was
visible between the trees. It grew darker, but she
did not move; dew fell upon her shoulders, chilling
her; the lake breeze penetrated her thin garments,
but she replied only with a shiver. Her hands were
clenched on her breast. “Help me! Help me!” she
whispered her soul crying to a Power outside herself.</p>

<h1 id='t6785'>CHAPTER XIX</h1>

<p>The moon lighted Jim Ashe to the spot where
Tim Bennett and his company of lumberjacks
waited. It must be confessed that Jim’s thoughts
on the way had more to do with Marie Ducharme
than with the enterprise of the night. He thought
of Michael Moran, too; hoped in a vague sort of
way that the night might bring him face to face with
Moran in not peaceful circumstances, for he was
young enough to feel the need of settling scores in a
physical manner.</p>

<p>Bennett and the men were awaiting him impatiently,
though he arrived a full half-hour before
his time. They crowded about him, appraising him
as a leader, for many of them had never seen him
before. He satisfied them. Bennett had told them
stories of Sudden Jim which they approved. The
result was that they were willing, eager to follow
wherever he might lead, careless of consequences to
themselves.</p>

<p>“I worked for your dad,” shouted a huge Irishman.
“Then you worked for a better man than I,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>“It’s a proper son that admits the same,” replied
the man.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Jim, “we may have a tough job this
night and we may have an easy one. We’ll figure it
at its toughest. You came without knowing why
you were coming. I’ll tell you. We’re going to
seize the Diversity Hardwood Company’s logging
railroad; we’re going to take charge of the rolling
stock. We’re going to capture Camp One with all
the logs we can get, and enough standing timber to
cut what we need. There’s a fair gang in Camp
One, but mostly Poles and Hunkies and Italians.”</p>

<p>“L’ave us at ’em!” bellowed the big Irishman.
“Shut up and listen,” said Jim, sharply; and the
Irishman grinned delightedly. That was the way
to speak up to a man.</p>

<p>“The engine is in the roundhouse. Ten trucks
stand on the siding near it. There are twenty
more trucks at the landings by Camp One. Can
anybody here run a locomotive?”</p>

<p>“Me,” said a stocky Dane.</p>

<p>“There’ll be nobody there but a watchman or so.
Take ten men and make for town. Land on that
roundhouse at eleven o’clock. Hitch on to the trucks
and scoot for the woods with them. Pick your own
men and start now. The rest of us hike across lots
to Camp One. You didn’t forget peavey handles, I
see.” Jim grinned down at them and leaped from
his buggy.</p>

<p>The parties separated, one moving townward, the
other into the woods in the direction of the Diversity
Company’s cuttings. With the latter went Jim.</p>

<p>They marched through the moonlit woods gaily
as to a merrymaking, but withal as silently as such
men could march. They jostled one another,
slyly tripped one another, found delight in holding
down springy saplings so they would spring back
to switch the ears of the man coming behind. It
was a picnic of big boys—which would be no picnic
when they stripped and got down to business.</p>

<p>For half an hour they stumbled along. An unexpected
voice called from the obscurity ahead.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Jim demanded. He knew here
was none of his own men; wondered who else was
abroad in the woods at that time of night. “Who
is it?”</p>

<p>“Gilders,” said the man, stepping into view. The
rifle, which seemed as much a part of his usual costume
as his floppy hat, was under his arm. He
stopped, was surrounded by Jim’s lumberjacks.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here at this time of night?”
Jim demanded.</p>

<p>“I am here—many places—at what time of night
is best,” said Gilders. “Night or day—what’s the
difference?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I cut
across from town to catch you. Moran’s warned.
He’s got a dozen men at the roundhouse. They’ve
telephoned the camps.”</p>

<p>Moran warned! It seemed impossible. Who
could have given warning? Jim named over mentally
those who knew what was afoot. Zaanan
Frame—he had not talked. Allen—he, too, was a
safe man. Grierson—oxen could not have drawn a
word from him. Marie Ducharme? She knew.
Jim had seen Moran going to her but an hour before.
Marie Ducharme. He would not believe she could
be guilty of such a betrayal of confidence. It was
not in her to commit such an act. Yet she had not
seemed herself. Something had happened. She
had been afraid. Jim closed his eyes, bit his under
lip. No one else who knew could have given the
warning. The opportunity had been hers. The
logic of events bore against her.</p>

<p>Jim turned to Gilders.</p>

<p>“Can you lead me to town the way you came?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Tim Bennett, you’re boss of the gang that goes
to the camp. I’ll take ten men away from you.
You’ll have thirty—it ought to be enough. You”—he
pointed to a man—“come with me, and you and
you and you.” He selected his men. “On the
jump,” he said to Gilders, and at the heels of their
guide they plunged headlong to re-enforce the party
that had gone before.</p>

<p>Jim held a match to his watch. It was fifteen
minutes past ten. They had three-quarters of an
hour to reach a point that could not be reached in
less than an hour. When they arrived the battle
for the roundhouse would have been on a quarter
of an hour. If Moran’s party were strong enough
that quarter of an hour might spell defeat for the
whole enterprise. If the first attacking party could
hold out until Jim arrived—</p>

<p>“Hustle,” Jim said, briefly, and saved his breath
for the exertion before him.</p>

<p>The men went silently now, grimly. The smell of
imminent battle was in their noses. Ahead of them
were comrades facing uneven odds. It was not
simply to fight that they hurried, but to succor their
friends. Jim’s legs, untrained to woods travel, cried
out for rest, but his will compelled them on.</p>

<p>At last lights shone below them, the black tube
of the Diversity Company’s smokestack lifted into
the star-shimmering sky—ten minutes would take
them to it. They heard a sudden, distant shout,
other shouts, a babel of sounds subdued by distance.
The fight for the roundhouse was on.
The attacking party had struck, had met surprising
resistance.</p>

<p>“Run!” shouted Jim.</p>

<p>They ran, stumbling, falling headlong. Men’s
breath came pantingly; bruised shins were paid for
in brief oaths. Each man sought to outdistance his
fellows, to be first to add his weight to the tide of
battle.</p>

<p>Down the last gully they charged, across the flat
before the mills, over the tracks. Before them
loomed the roundhouse, now bright with electric
light. Before the big doors swayed and writhed
a group of men. Other dark figures, two and two,
quaintly intertwined, moved and struggled and smote
like living silhouettes. Hoarse shouts arose; the
thud of blows; the shuffling of feet came to Jim’s
ears. Then he was in the midst of it.</p>

<p>Even with the addition of Jim’s reinforcements
his party was outnumbered; but Moran’s men,
under the shock and surprise of the charge, gave
way, but only for an instant. Inside, Jim saw the
engine, steam up, a man in the cab. They were
getting ready to bring it out. Why? he asked
himself, even as the sight of it was shut out and he
was hemmed in by fighting men.</p>

<p>It was Jim’s first real fight. It came to him
suddenly that he could fight, that he was worthy
to stand side by side with these lumberjacks, to give
blows where they gave blows, and he was glad.</p>

<p>Again he caught a brief glimpse of the interior
of the roundhouse as a man before him went down
under a blow from his fist. On the tender he saw
Michael Moran—not fighting, but watching, directing.
He saw a man break away from the melee and
leap toward the engine, recognized Gilders. His
teeth were bared, his hands empty. Jim struggled
forward, shot another look, saw Moran, his face distorted
with rage, raise a chunk of coal above his
head and hurl it. Whether it found its mark or not
Jim could not tell.</p>

<p>Jim’s men were holding their own. Though outnumbered,
they were trained to battle of this sort,
with inherited talent for it, against men not bred to
fight with their hands. But Moran’s men fought,
and fought well. Numbers made them even, if not
superior.</p>

<p>It was apparent they had been told to guard the
big door, for as best they could they remained solidly
before it. They were not men to take the offensive
on their own initiative, nor, Jim thought, would they
assume it under orders unless the enemy were in
actual retreat. It was a point to be taken advantage
of. He wormed and wriggled out of the fight,
marked the Dane who could drive an engine, and
hauled him out, struggling. At random the two of
them separated two others from the confusion.</p>

<p>“The engine,” Jim panted. “Side door. Come
on!”</p>

<p>They scurried to a small door left unguarded, and
plunged through. The engine was before them,
Moran still on the tender. On the ground lay
Gilders. Moran’s missile had flown true. The
Dane with his companions stormed the cab. In an
instant they had hurled down the engineer, hurled
him so ungently that he did not rise. Jim dodged
a lump of coal which Moran hurled, and himself
threw a peavey handle which he had picked up somewhere
in the fight. It caught Moran amidships so
that he crumpled up on the coal, the breath knocked
from his overnourished, undertrained body. Jim
scrambled to his side, lifted him and dumped him
off with scant regard for how or where he fell.</p>

<p>“Toot the whistle!” he yelled. “Back her out.”</p>

<p>The whistle screeched, and in that confined space
its voice was the voice of many demons. The
wheels began to turn.</p>

<p>“One man up here,” Jim ordered, and when the
man came he set an example by lifting his voice in
battle-cry, by hurling lumps of coal at the backs of
the defenders.</p>

<p>They turned. Taken in the rear by a new enemy,
menaced by a down-bearing locomotive, their morale
departed, they scattered to each side, broke, some
even turned in sudden flight. Jim’s lumberjacks
did the rest.</p>

<p>The locomotive moved out on a clear track,
backed to the switch where stood the empty trucks.
It was Jim who coupled them to the engine.</p>

<p>“We’ve done the job here,” he said to the big
Irishman who was his companion on the tender.
“Collect the boys and load ’em on the trucks.
We’re off for the woods. Maybe Bennett’s gang is
chewing on more than it can swallow. Somebody
see to Gilders inside there.”</p>

<p>A few moments more saw the little army perched
precariously on the trucks. They were bruised,
bleeding, clothing was in tatters, eyes were draped
in black, clearings appeared where once had grown
strong white teeth. But they were jubilant, for
victory had been theirs. They celebrated it noisily.</p>

<p>Slowly, with great rattling and jangling, with song
and cheer, they moved away from the roundhouse,
out of the yard and out upon the narrow-gauge track
which led back into the woods. Five miles of uncomfortable
travel lay between them and Camp One,
but its discomforts were not detectable by them.
They had won. It had been a fight worth while,
and they had won. Another fight lay before them
perhaps. They hoped so.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jim Ashe did not know it, but he had tied
these men to him with bonds of admiration. From
this day they were his friends, would work for him,
fight for him. He had fought shoulder to shoulder
with them. His quick thought had turned the day
in their favor. He was a man who dared, a man who
stood on his two feet and wielded fist or peavey
handle like a man—he was one of them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Sudden Jim?” somebody
yelled.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” answered back a tumultuous
shout, and Jim was more than pleased. He had
been tendered an honor which he knew how to
appreciate.</p>

<p>“Look out for Crab Creek Trestle,” the Irishman
said. “If Moran was on the job he’d jerk a rail
and treat us to a drop into the marsh.”</p>

<p>“Slack down at Crab Creek,” Jim shouted to his
engineer. He scrambled forward to the cab, and
sat looking forward where the headlight peered
ahead, illuminating the track.</p>

<p>“She’s bane joost ahead,” said the engineer.
In a moment the trestle came into view. As the
light rested on it two black figures emerged from the
underbrush to run out upon the structure, where they
stopped. The sound of sledge striking steel came
back distinctly through the clear air.</p>

<p>Jim leaped from the engine, half a dozen men at
his heels. Out upon the trestle they ran, all undesirable
risks for an accident insurance company at
the minute. The sledge continued to rise and fall,
but when Jim was within fifty feet of the men they
dropped their implements over the edge and ran.
Jim stopped to appraise the damage. His men kept
up the pursuit with success, for in a moment he heard
a shout of glee and saw a man performing antics in
the air as he descended into the marsh muck below.</p>

<p>Moran’s men had been too slow. Another minute
or so and a rail would have been loosened, but their
few blows had not sufficed. The trestle was safe to
pass.</p>

<p>“Four men stop here,” Jim said, and motioned the
train on.</p>

<p>Ten minutes more and they were at Camp One.
There were noises of frolic, but none of battle.</p>

<p>“Get cheated out of your fight?” Jim asked Tim
Bennett as the cant-dog man hurried up to the
engine.</p>

<p>“Not what you could notice,” grinned Tim, displaying
a split lip and barked knuckles. “But they
was Wops or somethin’. We chased ’em into the
cook-shanty, where they bide in fear and tremblin’.”</p>

<p>“Is there enough moon to load those trucks?”</p>

<p>Tim looked at Jim and grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be for anybody but you, Mr.
Ashe, but these here boys ’u’d work for you if it was
so dark you couldn’t feel a pin stick into you.”</p>

<p>“Leave enough men to hold the gang in the cook-shanty.
Take the rest and load. How many
trucks can that engine haul down?”</p>

<p>“Twenty, on a pinch.”</p>

<p>“Pick as much maple as you can,” said Jim.
“You’re boss.”</p>

<p>Given landings, twoscore men who know how to
use cant-hooks can handle an astonishing number
of logs in an hour. Twenty trucks were not filled
in sixty minutes, but the train was ready before
dawn—twenty trucks carrying thirty-five thousand
feet of hardwood logs.</p>

<p>“Now the cook-shanty,” said Jim. “We need it.”</p>

<p>The crew rollicked to the log house which was
cook-shanty at one end, bunkhouse at the other.
Jim parleyed.</p>

<p>“Come out and we’ll let you go,” he called.</p>

<p>Thoroughly frightened, the foreigners emerged.</p>

<p>“Hit for town,” Jim told them. “Your job’s gone.
Start walking and keep it up—we’ll be behind you
and it won’t be healthy if we catch up.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Jim’s crew were breakfasting
on Moran’s coffee and salt pork. It was a species of
humor they could enjoy. The night, with its incidents,
had furnished them a story to be told on
many evenings in diverse places.</p>

<p>“Fifteen men on the train,” Jim ordered. “The
rest load the other ten trucks. We’ll be back for
’em if Moran doesn’t eat us somewhere along the
road.”</p>

<p>Jim rode back in the engine cab, tired, but filled
with a notable satisfaction. He knew he had scored
heavily, though his victory was by no means permanent.
Altogether, perhaps, he was more pleased
with himself than the state of affairs quite warranted.
The engineer reminded him of this by asking what
they were to do for coal when the supply in the tender
was exhausted. Jim could give no reply.</p>

<p>However, he gave his reply after the train of logs
had passed the Diversity Company’s mills, passed
them to an accompaniment of cheers and jeers
from the men riding on the trucks. For Jim had
seen two cars of coal standing on a siding.</p>

<p>“There’s our coal,” he said to the engineer.
“We’ll borrow it on the way back.”</p>

<p>And borrow it they did, calmly, under the noses
of the enemy.</p>

<p>One more trip to Camp One and return Jim made
that day. Another thirty-odd thousand feet of
timber was unloaded in his log-yard. He left Tim
Bennett in charge, directing him to handle logs as
he had never handled them before, and himself
went to his office.</p>

<p>Beam and Nelson followed him gleefully. But the
surprise of the day was supplied by Grierson, who
emerged from his bookkeeping lair, his eyes not free
from a moisture the origin of which was open to
suspicion, and grasped Jim’s hand.</p>

<p>“I wish your father could have been here to see it,”
he said, and retreated hastily behind his barrier again.</p>

<h1 id='t7220'>CHAPTER XX</h1>

<p>Diversity chattered and gesticulated,
surmised and prophesied. It did not know exactly
what had happened, but was able to relate much
more than had happened. The one protruding fact
was that Michael Moran had the worst of the
affair. The Ashe Clothespin Company was sawing
logs which Moran had intended they should not
saw, and young Jim Ashe bounded to local fame—not
altogether admirable. The character assigned him
was a patchwork of daredevil, Machiavelli, business
genius, general, pugilist, bandit, patriot. It depended
on whom you talked with which attribute
was set foremost.</p>

<p>By night some credit had been subtracted from
Jim to be piled up before Zaanan Frame’s door as
censure. The idea had been circulated subtlely.
A reign of lawlessness was to be inaugurated.
Zaanan Frame, the county’s dictator, winked at it,
even lent his aid to it. He had debauched the courts
themselves, so that, instead of giving their protection
to Moran, assailed in his sacred rights of property,
they actually issued injunctions forbidding him to
interfere with men who, to all intents, were stealing
his timber.</p>

<p>Peleg Goodwin made a speech about it from the
steps of the hotel, and many good citizens believed
him. Jim discovered suddenly he had become an
important part of the political issue.</p>

<p>When supper-time came he walked down the road,
hesitated in front of the hotel, half of a mind to eat
there, for he did not want to meet Marie Ducharme
yet. In his office he had been thinking of her, had
been trying to argue himself into a belief in her
fidelity; but it had been futile. The evidence seemed
proof incontrovertible to him. He believed she had
betrayed his confidence to Michael Moran.</p>

<p>His hesitation was brief. With a shrug of his
shoulders he went on to the widow’s. As well have
the meeting now as any time, he thought. He was
young; he had given his heart, his faith wholly, and
his spirit was sick with the shock of disillusionment.
Where he loved he had been betrayed—wantonly, it
seemed to him. So he went grimly to the widow’s
table. His face might have borne a far different
expression could he have known Marie Ducharme
had not closed her eyes through the night, nor till
mid-morning brought assurances of his safety. Tenderness
and pity might have mingled in his heart
could he have known of her struggle on the little
hilltop under the moon. But he did not know.</p>

<p>“H’m!” said the widow, as he entered. “Fine
carryin’s-on! I’ve had boarders and boarders, but
I don’t call to mind none been as like to get hauled
out from under my roof by the sheriff as you.
What you mean by it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think the sheriff will interfere with me,”
said Jim, humorlessly, forgetting or neglecting to
greet Marie with even a nod of the head.</p>

<p>“Them that lives by the sword shall die by the
sword,” the widow said, seeking the support of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>“And those who live by logs must have logs,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>“Folks is sayin’ Zaanan Frame was back of this
caper of yours. ’Tain’t so, is it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Knew he wouldn’t be lendin’ his countenance to
murderin’ and killin’ and maimin’ and injurin’.”</p>

<p>“There would have been no fighting,” said Jim,
his eyes on the tablecloth, “if my plans hadn’t been
betrayed to Moran.”</p>

<p>“Who done that, I’d like to know?” said the
widow, quick to change her front. “Who’d ’a’ done
such a miserable, sneakin’, low-down thing as that?
You ought to ketch him and teach him sich a lesson
he wouldn’t forgit it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Jim, dully. “You see, it wasn’t
a man.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Serves you right, then, for lettin’ a woman
find out what you was goin’ to do.”</p>

<p>Jim made no reply, did not lift his eyes, so he was
unconscious of the look Marie bent upon him. Her
eyes were startled, dark with apprehension. His
manner toward her, what did it mean? Did he suspect
her? She bit her lip and pretended to eat.
Presently she excused herself and left the room
with lagging steps.</p>

<p>Jim finished his meal silently. He, too, went out,
his feet heavy as his heart as he descended the steps
and walked along the bricked path to the gate.
Marie was waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Jim,” she said, “what did you mean? You
acted so—what you said—”</p>

<p>“I meant,” said Jim, dully, “that within an hour
from the time I told you what I was going to do,
Moran was warned.”</p>

<p>“You believe that I warned him?”</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried. “No! I didn’t see Moran last
night, Jim. I didn’t see him. I didn’t tell him.”</p>

<p>“You only make it worse,” he said. “Moran was
here. I saw him turn in the gate.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t here, Jim. I didn’t see him. I ran
away from him because I was afraid. You don’t
know how afraid of him I am, Jim. I begged you
to stay home last night—but you couldn’t; so I
ran away. He comes, Jim, and shows me the world—out
there. He offers it to me—and I want it,
I want it! He doesn’t put things into words;
but I—I understand him. I—I hate him! But the
longing; this awful place—You said you loved
me, Jim, and I wouldn’t accept your love. You
didn’t love me, you couldn’t love me, or you wouldn’t
believe—”</p>

<p>“I loved you and I trusted you. I would have
trusted you with everything a man can trust a woman
with. And you—you hardly waited till I was out of
sight before you told him.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with agony in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. Yes, I’ll tell you, and then you
must believe. I—I did love you, Jim, even when I
refused you. It is true. You make me tell you.
And last night—out there on that knoll—I found I
couldn’t go on without you. I saw things clearly.
I understood what love meant. And my fear of
him went away, because I was going to let you
know, and then I would be safe—safe with you.
Oh, Jim, I was not with him one second. I was out
there, sending my heart after you. Now you believe
me, don’t you, Jim?” Her voice was pitiful.</p>

<p>Each word Jim uttered seemed a bit torn grimly
from his heart. He did not believe her. Now that
his trust in her was gone, his unbelief grew and
multiplied.</p>

<p>“I am a new-comer in your life,” he said. “Moran
has been there for years. You—he saw you attracted
me. That became useful to him. Last
night shows how useful. Why do you say these
things to me about love? Love is not a thing to lie
about. I know what love is, because you—some
one I thought was you—had made it live in me. I
don’t believe you now. I shall never believe you
again. The thing you have just said is not true.
I believe you have said it—in obedience to him. So
he might have an eye which would look into my
very soul.”</p>

<p>He stopped. She stood silent, pale, her lips parted
as in horror. One hand crept upward flutteringly,
stopped at her breast, moved outward toward Jim.</p>

<p>“Jim!” she whispered. “Jim! You didn’t say
that. Tell me I didn’t hear that. Tell me! Tell
me! You don’t know what you’re saying, what
you’re doing. I had won. I had struggled and
won. Don’t send me back to him.” Suddenly she
gave way and threw herself on a bench beside the
path, her hands over her ears as though to shut out
some dreadful sound. “It’s a lie!” she panted. “A
lie! A lie! A lie!”</p>

<p>Jim felt himself near the breaking-point. He
turned and hurried, almost ran, out of the widow’s
garden, but even as far as the gate he could hear her
voice repeating: “A lie! A lie! A lie!”</p>

<h1 id='t7417'>CHAPTER XXI</h1>

<p>All next day train-loads of logs came down from
Camp One to be decked in Jim’s yard. Thirty-five
thousand feet had been rolled off the first night
and day; upward of forty thousand feet were added
to it the second. It was enough to supply the saws
for a week. Moran had made no visible move; no
attempt to interfere with the men in the woods or
with the running of trains had been made. This did
not reassure Jim. Moran was not the man to be
beaten so easily. He knew he would strike back—that
the Clothespin Club would strike back—for
Moran and the Club were as one in this war.</p>

<p>The blow came from the Club—one not altogether
unlooked for. It was their logical move, but it
would be costly to them. News of it came in
telegrams from Jim’s agents, telling him that Welliver
and Jenkins and Plum were offering clothespins at a
further cut of ten per cent. in price.</p>

<p>Jim figured rapidly. He knew that now his mill
was running efficiently, his crew of operators were
trained, each machine was showing its production
of seventy-five boxes of pins or better a day, he was
making pins more cheaply than any other manufacturer
in the country. He knew they could not
make pins at such a price; that every box sold at
such a figure represented a loss. It represented a
loss to Jim of something like a cent and a half a box.
Probably it meant from three to five cents to the
Club. But they could stand it for a time. They had
capital in reserve. Jim had none, or very little,
to carry on an extended war. But fight he had to,
whether he had the money or not.</p>

<p>Perhaps he could borrow more, but he very much
doubted it. One resource he had—the option on
old Louis Le Bar’s timber. That must be sold at
once.</p>

<p>He determined to take the afternoon train to
Grand Rapids to go over it in the big lumber offices.
His immediate action was to wire his representatives
generally to take no orders at the new price. To
New York and Chicago he gave directions to sell one
car-load each at a drop of five per cent. under the
Club’s last figure. This would serve further to
demoralize the markets in those centers and to
compel the Club to protect its customers on the
additional decline. It would cost Jim a few hundreds
of dollars. How much more expensive it would
be to the Club he did not know.</p>

<p>The morning found him in Grand Rapids. The
lumbermen received him with suspicion. It was apparent
they were aware of his existence, had expected
his arrival. They were willing to talk, but not to
deal. They knew the Le Bar tract, of course. It
was desirable, but none of them cared to undertake it.</p>

<p>Their attitude was difficult to understand until
one old gentleman bruskly informed Jim he did not
care to spend his good money buying a lawsuit.</p>

<p>“Why a lawsuit?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“We were tipped off to you, young man. From
a dependable source we know there’s something
wrong with that tract, and we’re taking no chances
on it.”</p>

<p>“Have you investigated it? Will you investigate
it?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s a desirable tract, but it’s not necessary.
We can get along without it, and just now we’re too
busy to go fooling round with a doubtful title.”</p>

<p>“You can easily investigate the title.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? We know your option is disputed.
We know we’d take on a lawsuit with it, and
we don’t need any lawsuits.”</p>

<p>At last Jim understood. Moran had taken his
steps, as he said he would. He had promised that
Jim would be unable to dispose of his option, and
had made good his promise. The task had been
simple. He had notified all possible buyers that he
would contest Jim’s option; that he claimed some
lien or title. Jim knew when he came face to face
with the impassable. He put his option in his
pocket and returned to Diversity.</p>

<p>Neither magazine nor newspaper could hold his
attention on the train. His mind could not be made
to forget the weight that lay upon it; his heart could
not be numbed to pain by anaesthetic. Jim was
young. Suffering was new to him, and experience
had not showed him how best to endure it.</p>

<p>It was not the ruin that hung over his business that
clouded with anguish the eyes he fixed on the
scudding landscape. It was not the knowledge that
he was in a corner, fighting for his financial life with
his back to the wall. It was Marie—only Marie.
Youth can look forward to the building of another
fortune; the losses of to-day will be wiped out in the
gains of to-morrow. But when love crashes down
in sordid ruin there is no to-morrow. Youth cannot
see that the unguent of time will close the wound;
it can see only that hope, the sweet anticipations
which make of the future a magical realm almost
within the grasp of the extending hand, has been
swept away beyond recall.</p>

<p>Marie was not true, steadfast, as he had believed;
her soul did not shine clearly, purely, with the guiding
light he thought he had seen. Marie, the wonderful,
the womanly, was erased from the picture; replaced
by one sordid, despicable, treacherous even.
Perhaps the bitterest pain is rending asunder of the
trust of youth.</p>

<p>What remained? Work, feverish exertion, the
comfort of facing an antagonist, of straining breast
to breast with him.</p>

<p>At the junction Jim changed to the Diversity railroad.
In the smoker when he entered was a sprinkling
of Diversity folk, who, as the train got in
motion, edged together to talk politics. Politics in
Diversity was a topic of conversation as it had not
been for twenty years. Zaanan Frame had taken
the zest from it. He had been the county’s politics
so long. In the eyes of the inhabitants the present
condition assumed almost the importance of a
revolution.</p>

<p>“Zaanan’s beat, and he knows it,” was an opinion
boldly expressed. “He hain’t even makin’ a fight
for it. Calc’late he’s too old.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late,” replied a gesticulating individual,
“he’s plum disgusted. Who’s the best friend Diversity
folks has had, eh? Zaanan Frame; that’s
who. And now, because a dollar for a vote is easy
money to earn, men that ought to think shame is
turnin’ against him. It hain’t that he can’t fight.
Don’t git sich an idee into your head. It’s that he’s
too disgusted to fight.”</p>

<p>“He’s run things long enough. Nobody kin call
his soul his own. He comes perty clost to sayin’
who shall marry who, and which kind of a baby
they’ll have after they’re married. We hain’t goin’
to stand that kind of thing much longer. No, sir;
we’re a-goin’ to run our own affairs like we want
to—”</p>

<p>“You’re a-goin’ to swap Zaanan Frame for Michael
Moran, that’s what you’re goin’ to do—and you’re
welcome to your bargain. Wait till Moran gits the
power Zaanan’s got now. See how he uses it. Has
any feller here got a word to say ag’in Zaanan’s
honesty? Eh?”</p>

<p>Nobody replied.</p>

<p>“Kin anybody here lay his hand on a wrong
Zaanan’s done? Kin anybody p’int to a case in
court that hain’t come out as near fair and just as
human men kin make it? No, you can’t. But
wait. Why d’you calc’late Moran is reachin’ out
for Zaanan’s place? It’s so he can chase the law
out and put Mike Moran’s will in. That’s why.
It’s so he kin make of Diversity what Quartus
Hembly made of Owasco a few years back. He’ll
rob you and git his courts to back him up; there’ll
be wrongs done and nobody punished. Diversity
is run by Zaanan Frame because we’ve turned over
the job to him. But it’s run like an American town.
Moran’ll run it like a town in Roosian Siberier.
Mark me!”</p>

<p>“I call to mind the times ’fore Zaanan got his
office first,” piped up a toothless octogenarian.
“Diversity and Hell was first cousins. Sich things
as I’ve seen! Wa-al, Zaanan he turned to, and
’twa’n’t long ’fore there wa’n’t a quieter, better-behaved
town in the timber. He’s deserved a heap
of this town.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone too far. Kind of figgers he’s king, or
somethin’ like that. We hain’t goin’ to stand for it
no more.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” squeaked the old man; “whatever
you git is comin’ to you. ’Twon’t be a year ’fore
you’re on your knees prayin’ for Zaanan Frame to
come back, and it’ll be too late, ’cause this Moran’ll
have the power and nobody’ll git it away from him.”</p>

<p>“Zaanan’s beat,” repeated the first speaker.</p>

<p>“Looks so,” admitted the old man; “but money
done it. Votes has been bought, lies has been told.
He hain’t beat fair.”</p>

<p>Jim was interested in spite of himself. Here was a
fight, one more fight for him to get into. He,
clearer than these men, saw what it would mean to
the town and county for Moran to become its
dictator. He welcomed another task; it would coax
his mind away from Marie. If the new task was
also a high duty of citizenship it was so much the
more welcome. He sat erect in his seat; again he
was Sudden Jim. He addressed the men within hearing.</p>

<p>“Zaanan Frame isn’t beaten,” he said. “Maybe
he won’t fight for himself, but there are folks who
will fight for him, and I’m one of them. The time’s
short, but, you men who are against him, take this
thought away with you: If you’ve taken money for
your votes or influence, begin to worry. If there has
been crookedness you may carry word from me to
the man who is to blame for it that he shall answer
for his crookedness. The time’s short, as I said,
but a lot of fighting can be done in a short time.
It isn’t too late.”</p>

<p>“And you’re some fighter, Mr. Ashe,” grinned a
little Irishman. “When you come into the car I
says to my friend, says I, ‘There’s an illigant lad
wid knuckles to his fists.’”</p>

<p>“Thanks, O’Toole. Tell the boys I’m against the
man who robs his woodsmen in the wanigans. Tell
them I’m against the man who would steal away
their chance to get justice. Tell them I know
Zaanan Frame is their best friend, and beg them to
vote for him.”</p>

<p>“Have no worries about the b’ys wid corked
boots,” said O’Toole. “Think ye we don’t know
Mike Moran?”</p>

<p>“But Zaanan won’t help himself,” said the old
man.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Zaanan the minute we get to town,”
promised Jim.</p>

<p>He kept his word. From the train he walked
straight to Zaanan’s office. Dolf Springer sat on
the door-step, his head hunched down between his
shoulders, a very picture of disconsolation. He
scarcely looked up as Jim passed him.</p>

<p>Zaanan, as always in his leisure moments, was
reading Tiffany’s <span class='it'>Justices’ Guide</span>. Jim fancied that
the old man’s figure was less erect than formerly,
that it drooped with discouragement, with disappointment
over the crumbling of the work of his
life. Jim could mark on Zaanan’s face the effects of
the blow he had received when it became plain his
people were turning against him. To realize their
ingratitude, how little they appreciated the expenditure
of his life in their behalf, must have grieved the
old justice sorely.</p>

<p>He greeted Jim with his usual brief phrase,
“Howdy?”</p>

<p>“Judge,” said Jim, breaking impetuously into the
subject of his coming, wasting no time in preliminaries,
“we’ve got to get up and stir ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Um! What’s been happenin’ to you now?
Worried ’cause you couldn’t sell your option?”</p>

<p>Jim was a bit startled at Zaanan’s knowledge of
the failure of his errand, but brushed aside his
curiosity to know how the old justice came by his
information.</p>

<p>“It’s not myself I’m worrying about; it’s you,
Judge, and Diversity. Even your friends admit
you’re beaten. They say you admit it yourself.
They think you’re too old to get out and fight.”</p>

<p>“Heard me admittin’ I was beat, Jim, eh? Heard
me sayin’ any sich thing?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Think I’m too old, Jim, eh? Past my usefulness?”</p>

<p>“You’re the best man of all of us. That’s why—”</p>

<p>Zaanan’s eyes twinkled for a moment, then he
bent his head in an attitude of weariness, “Folks
is tired of me, Jim. They calc’late I’ve outstayed
my welcome. Noticed that, Jim, eh?”</p>

<p>“They’ve been bamboozled into thinking it, or
paid to think it.”</p>

<p>“But they think it, all the same. Any reason I
shouldn’t give ’em a chance to run their logs without
me? See why I shouldn’t git a minnit’s peace and
quiet at the tail end of my life, eh? Specially when
folks is anxious I should?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Judge, I do see a reason. These are your
people. You’ve made them what they are. You’ve
looked after them for years and, maybe, because
you’ve looked after them so thoroughly and well,
they are less able to look after themselves than they
should be. You’re responsible for them. Nobody
but you can save them and this town from passing
into a condition that will be intolerable. You aren’t
entitled to rest. You’ve got to get into this fight—and
win.”</p>

<p>“Perty late, hain’t it, Jim? Perty late in the
day?”</p>

<p>“We’ll just have to work that much harder.”</p>

<p>“Dun’no’s I kin agree with you, Jim. Seems to me
time’s too short. Maybe I should ’a’ fought, but
there wa’n’t much encouragement. Folks was
flockin’ to Peleg. Shouldn’t wonder if a dose of
Peleg ’u’d be the thing to cure ’em.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t leave them in the lurch. It’s natural
you should feel hard against them, but they-they’ve
been fooled. It’s not their fault.”</p>

<p>“Somehow, Jim, I don’t feel as able to undertake
things as I did once.” Zaanan’s voice was weary,
old. “Looks to me like it would be wastin’ time to
stir things up now. Calc’late I’m done for, Jim.”</p>

<p>“All your friends haven’t left you. But they need
you to lead them. They don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“There hain’t nothin’ to do, Jim, against Moran
and all his money.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you come out and try? Go down
fighting, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t no occasion for it, Jim. Better save up
what strength I’ve got left. No use wastin’ it in
vain efforts.”</p>

<p>A surge of sympathy for the old man welled up in
Jim. Sitting there in the latter end of his days,
deserted by friends, abandoned by those for whom
he had striven for a score of years, he could not be
contemplated unmoved. In his discouragement he
was pitiful indeed.</p>

<p>“Judge,” Jim said, impulsively, “I wish I could
drop everything and jump into this thing for you.
I can’t do that, but I can do something. Until
caucus day I’m going to give every possible minute
to this election, whether you help or not.”</p>

<p>“Much obleeged,” said Zaanan, without enthusiasm.
“What’s your special int’rest in this
thing, eh? Seems to me like you was consid’able
wrought up over it.”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated.</p>

<p>What was his interest? Was it merely hatred for
Moran, or was it something worthier? He paused
to search his soul for the answer.</p>

<p>“Before my father induced me to take over this
business I had other plans. I had been a newspaper
man in the city. I had seen things, and it
seemed to me that there was room for somebody
who wanted to help. The people—the people at
the bottom of the heap—need help, Judge. They
don’t belong. They pay their dues in money or
labor, but they’re not members. They have none
of the privileges. Perhaps they aren’t entitled to the
privileges; perhaps they wouldn’t know what to
do with them if they got them, but they’re entitled
to something. Our Declaration of Independence
says something about all men being born free and
equal. In theory that may be true. In practice
only those are free and equal who are strong enough
to force others to recognize their freedom and
equality. I wanted to do something—one man could
do only a little—toward helping the bottom of the
heap out from under to where the weight of the top
of the heap wouldn’t crush them.”</p>

<p>“Um! One of them newfangled socialists, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know just what a socialist
is, but if what I’ve said makes me one, then I’m
guilty of the charge.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t jest normal for a feller employin’ men and
women like you do.”</p>

<p>“That is one of the things that moved me to
accept father’s proposition when he turned things
over to me. I could do my small part here. I
could at least see that my bottom-heapers got a
fair trade from me, who was their top-heaper.
And I guess that’s why I’m interested in this election.
You’ve kept things spread out so the bottom was
not smashed by the top. Moran wants to take your
place so he can crush the bottom as he wants to.”</p>

<p>“Um! No pers’nal spite?”</p>

<p>Jim flushed.</p>

<p>“I hate Moran.”</p>

<p>“Not astonished to hear it. Now, abandonin’ the
election for a minute and takin’ up your affairs:
I bought me a couple shares in the Diversity Hardwood
Company t’other day. Had the chance.
Thought maybe you’d be wantin’ to take ’em off my
hands. Figgered you might find a use for ’em.
Think you kin, eh? Annual meetin’ of that corporation
comes day follerin’ caucus. Better git them
shares properly transferred on the company’s books
right off. Here they be.”</p>

<p>“But—” began Jim.</p>

<p>“Hain’t I said them shares might come in handy?
Paid two hundred dollars for ’em. Gimme check.”</p>

<p>Zaanan’s methods were now more or less familiar
to Jim. He knew the justice would not have bought
this stock for him without some good reason. He
scented some plan that Zaanan was working out.</p>

<p>“All right, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Git that transfer made right off.”</p>

<p>“Without fail,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“G’-by, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Judge. But I wish you—”</p>

<p>“G’-by, Jim,” repeated Zaanan, with a convincing
tone of finality.</p>

<p>From that day for the week that remained before
the caucus Jim talked, argued, pleaded with the
voters of Diversity. He even essayed public speaking;
hired the local opera-house for the purpose,
and there publicly denounced Peleg Goodwin as
Moran’s cat’s-paw; publicly excoriated Moran. But
he came to perceive his was a hopeless task.</p>

<p>He could not arouse the people. Zaanan himself
might have stirred them, but no stranger could.
Especially no stranger could stir them to fight for
Zaanan when Zaanan himself acknowledged defeat.</p>

<p>Some there were who fought shoulder to shoulder
with Jim. Dolf Springer did what was in him, and
when he saw the futility of it his watery eyes grew
more watery still. Dolf was faithful; Zaanan was
his great man. His faith in the goodness of God
was shaken.</p>

<p>Moran did not abate his exertions. He himself,
his agents, his hirelings, traversed the township, the
county. Ceaselessly they worked, and tirelessly,
efficiently. Their faces wore no looks of discouragement;
their bearing was jaunty. Any man with
half a political eye could see the victory was theirs.
On the eve of the caucus Jim grudgingly admitted
it, too.</p>

<p>That night—the hour was not quite nine—the
young man who was Grierson’s assistant in the bookkeeping
realm—his name was Newell—rushed up to
Jim on the hotel piazza. Obviously he was in a state
of high excitement.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe! Mr. Ashe!” he panted.</p>

<p>Jim drew him aside.</p>

<p>“What is it, Newell?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Crab Creek Trestle, Mr. Ashe. They’re going to
burn it to-night, so you can’t get any more logs.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? Who told you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the man—tall, carried a gun under
his arm.”</p>

<p>“Gilders,” said Jim to himself. It was sufficient
verification for him if the warning came from that man.
“All right, Newell. Go along about your business
and keep your mouth shut.”</p>

<p>Jim did not pause to determine the best course to
follow. For him there was but one course—instant
action. Without halt, without plan, without aid,
he set out for Crab Creek. It was a trip to be taken
afoot. No road led to the spot. Jim made for the
railroad, sped down it toward the threatened spot.</p>

<h1 id='t7942'>CHAPTER XXII</h1>

<p>Marie Ducharme was expecting Michael
Moran. He had sent word he would see her
that evening, and she, her heart numbed by the
blow it had received, was inclined to welcome him.
Her mood was one of recklessness, bred and nurtured
by days and nights of brooding over the injustice
of which she was the victim. She had spent her
night of agony and struggle; had come down from
the moonlit knoll strengthened, lifted up by a surrender
to love, exalted by victory won over sordid
temptations. She had come down with soul renewed,
purified, with fresh aspirations, with tender
hopes, with a sort of pitiful pride. The gates of
her heart had not been opened to the love that
gained admittance. She had heard it clamoring
without, had striven to exclude it; but it had won
past her barriers. Once within, she had fought
with it, opposed it with all the strength of her will.
When her capitulation came it was complete. And
Jim Ashe’s cruel accusation had been its reward.</p>

<p>Her moment of hysteria in the garden passed,
gave place to sullenness, to dull, throbbing pain,
to revolt. At first there had been amazed grief,
terror, unbelief in the possibility of such a thing.
It would not be true. Such a thing could not happen
to her. Realization followed. That it had
happened was past denial. In her supreme moment,
her moment of confession to Jim, he had rejected her
love, responded to it with scorn. She had laid low
her pride for his sake, and he had trampled on it.
There were moments when she fancied she hated him.
These moments recurred more frequently. Grief
gave way to anger. He had prated of love, of the
trust, the beauty of love, and at the first shadow his
love had not been trustful. He had denied her a
hearing, condemned her before she could make defense;
and as she had come to understand love, defenses
were abhorrent to it. His heart, his instinct,
should have held him steadfast in his faith. It had
failed, so his love had failed. Then love was not
what she had come to believe.</p>

<p>She had told Jim her love would be a fiery thing,
jealous, demanding. She had seen it so; but now
she knew love was not of that warp and woof.
The joy of love was in service, in surrender. It
lay not in compelling service of its object, but in
rendering service to him. In that spirit she had gone
to Jim; and how had he received her?</p>

<p>So she believed she hated him. Also, as she tried
to peer ahead, she saw a future without peace,
troubled, dark. If it were to be so, what was the
use of further struggle? In the old days she had
contemplated without abhorrence a deliberate choice
of the lower course. Now she fondled the suggestion.
If that way had pleasure, life, joys, no matter
how spurious, why should she not take them?
Life owed her something. Hitherto it had withheld;
latterly it had ruthlessly heaped woe upon her.
Why not reach out and seize whatever the world
had to give? It would entail pain, perhaps. But
would that be harder to bear than what lay ahead
if she held steadfast in the course she had chosen?
Love had come—and gone. It would not renew
its coming. Such was her judgment.</p>

<p>Moran came, sat beside her. He was agitated,
not wholly by his feeling for her, but by rage, jealousy,
vindictiveness which he burned to vent on Jim
Ashe. When he spoke, that gentler note which he
had used in talking to her on former occasions was
absent from his voice; it was harsh, strained. Marie
sat numb, silent, shivering a trifle. She was conscious
of a physical repulsion for the man; conscious
she would be compelled to pay a price exorbitant for
the toys she hoped to buy.</p>

<p>“Marie,” said Moran, “you’ve dallied with me.
You’ve held me off. You’ve pretended not to understand
me when I knew you understood, when it
was plain you did understand. And I’ve been
patient—because a man must be a fool when he
deals with women. You’re no child. You know
what you want. You know I can give it to you.
When are you going to make up your mind?”</p>

<p>“When I am ready to make up my mind. When
I know what I want.”</p>

<p>“You know now. It’s just the infernal woman
in you that wants to toy with a man. I’m no man
to be toyed with—past a safe point. I’d have been
contented to play your game a little longer if it
hadn’t been for old Frame’s meddling.”</p>

<p>“Judge Frame? What meddling?”</p>

<p>Moran shrugged his shoulders angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk as if you thought I was an imbecile.
What meddling? Don’t you suppose I knew why
old Frame sent that man Ashe here?” At mention
of Jim’s name Marie winced.</p>

<p>“Why did Judge Frame—”</p>

<p>“To marry you,” said Moran, his tone brutal as a
blow. “And you knew it. You’ve been playing
Ashe against me—to see which of us you could get
the most from. You’ve landed Ashe high and dry—anybody
can see that. It’s my business to see Ashe
doesn’t land you.”</p>

<p>Jealousy showed there. Marie flinched as though
Moran touched an exposed nerve.</p>

<p>“I hate him! I hate him!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Hate him or love him, it don’t matter. He
sha’n’t have you. I’ve fixed that.
After to-night—to-morrow—you won’t want
him if you want him
now. Maybe you hate him. I’m not fool enough
to believe it because you say so. It don’t matter.
I don’t care who you love or hate, so long as I have
you. I’d have smashed him, anyhow. That was
business. But he’s shoved in between you and me,
and I’ll smash him and stamp on him. It’s as good
as done. And Frame—he’ll be disposed of to-morrow.”
His voice was rising, becoming shrill as he
fanned his passion.</p>

<p>Marie felt the stirring of some emotion within her.
It was apprehension, fear. Even in that moment she
could scrutinize it as something outside herself, wonder
at it. Why was she apprehensive? She was not
afraid for herself. For whom was she afraid? She
must be afraid for Jim Ashe, for he was the threatened
man. It was unbelievable. She told herself she
did not, could not, care what befell Jim Ashe. She
hated him, despised him.</p>

<p>“You may as well cast Ashe out of your reckoning,”
Moran went on. “There’ll be nothing to
reckon on. I know what you want—money. Money
to buy excitement, movement, money to throw away,
money to buy for you everything Diversity can’t
give. I know. Well, Ashe will have trouble giving
you a decent meal in another twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“I do hate him!” Marie said, aloud, but to herself.
“I do! I do!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be glad to hear his stay in Diversity
is coming to a sudden end.”</p>

<p>Here was a threat which it seemed to her touched
Jim’s own person, his safety. Marie uttered a
scarce audible gasp. “Jim?” she whispered.
“No.... No.... Not that. Not Jim.” In that instant
she knew her fear was for Jim, a living, chilling
fear. If fear lived, then love must live, too. She
did not hate him; she had lied to herself, deceived
herself. No matter how he had wronged her, no
matter how he had judged her, she loved him. And
she was glad, glad, for it rekindled her faith in
human love. Love should forgive all, suffer all.
And she loved with such a love. It was good.</p>

<p>“I’m through waiting for your whims,” Moran
said. “What I want I take. I’ve put him out of
the way. I’ve made it necessary for you to come to
me. To-morrow you’ll be told you aren’t needed
here any more.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Marie.</p>

<p>“You’ll teach no more school in Diversity. You’ve
hated it. Well, I saw to that.”</p>

<p>She did not know if what he said were fact or
threat.</p>

<p>It did not matter. Moran had made his big mistake,
for hers was not a will to brook threat. If
more was needed to array her actively against him,
he had contributed what was needed.</p>

<p>In the gloom of the porch he could not see the
transformation that took place in her; could not see
that a different woman sat opposite him—a woman
alert, full of the wiles that from time immemorial
have been the weapon of women, a woman to fear.
The numbness that had clung to her, oppressed her—a
heavy fog obscuring the world—was wafted away
in an instant, as a fog on her own Lake Michigan
dissipated, disappeared before morning breeze and
morning sun. She sat there, not Marie Ducharme
crushed, ready for any fate that promised a measure
of kindliness, but Marie Ducharme with youth and
love in her heart—youth and love, and fear for the
man she loved.</p>

<p>And there was something else. There was the
will to fight for the love that was hers; the will to
win again what she had lost. It was not right, fair,
that she should lose. It was error. She did not
even blame Jim now. She was given to see that the
words he had spoken to her lacerated his own heart
more than they lacerated hers. Opposite Michael
Moran sat Marie Ducharme, fighting with all the
force and the gifts that were in her for the man she
loved.</p>

<p>She moved forward in her chair, leaned a little
toward Moran.</p>

<p>“You—you have a will,” she said.</p>

<p>Moran saw her weakening. It had been a perfect
thing, not too apparent, convincing.</p>

<p>“You’re through backing and filling,” he said,
stating it as a fact, not asking it as a question.</p>

<p>“And you’re sure—sure you can do what you say,
to him?”</p>

<p>He glanced at her quickly, astonished at the vindictiveness
that cut through her words.</p>

<p>“What’s he been doing to you?” he asked, jocularly.</p>

<p>“Enough. No matter. He—he can’t avoid it?
You know you can do as you say—crush him?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care to have you get a spite against
me, young lady. Yes, I’ve got him—so.” He
closed his hand tightly. “It’s a matter of business,
with you added to make it more interesting. I’m
here to make money, and I’m going to make some of
it out of Ashe—so much, in fact, that he won’t have
any left. And that’s interesting to you, isn’t it?
From now on he’s going to learn something about
business.”</p>

<p>“But,” she said, “he’s had the best of you, hasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“He bragged of that, eh? I’ll admit he had more
gumption than I figured on, but he’s gone his limit.
I’m taking personal charge now. He’s in deep water,
Marie. He’s up against a hard fight in his own line,
bucking a combination. They’ve put prices down
to where he loses money on every clothespin he
makes.</p>

<p>“He’s in deep—borrowed money all over the shop,
and no way to pay it. To-night will end his thrashing
round. Can’t run without logs.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Marie said, setting a thorn into Moran’s
skin, “but he’s getting logs. Didn’t he take your
logging-road away from you?”</p>

<p>“But he won’t run it any longer. You know where
Crab Creek Trestle is? Well, the logs are all on
the other side of it. And they’re going to stay there.
The Diversity Hardwood Company is going to have
the misfortune to lose its trestle by fire to-night.
He’ll have to shut down. Then creditors will get
worried. They’ll be down on him, but I’ll be there
a little ahead.”</p>

<p>“How?” said Marie, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I’m a director of the Diversity Bank,” he
chuckled. “Ashe borrowed thirty thousand dollars
of us, and gave a demand-note. You know what
that is?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow the note will be presented. He’ll
have to raise that amount of money inside of three
days—and he can’t do it. Oh, it won’t be long
before a man named Michael Moran will be manufacturing
clothespins with Ashe’s machinery.”</p>

<p>“But if you should fail about the trestle, if it
shouldn’t burn, would he be able to beat you and
keep his mill?”</p>

<p>Moran shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Possibly, but there’s no use thinking about that,
The trestle is as good as gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Marie, and sank back in her chair.</p>

<p>It was so complete, so perfect. Jim was beaten.
He had worked so hard, so faithfully; had builded
such high hopes—to go down in ruin! Jim! And
nothing she could do or say would stay the disaster,
would postpone it an instant. She shivered,
coughed.</p>

<p>“It’s cold. A moment while I get my shawl.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the house. Moran waited,
warmed by a feeling of complete satisfaction. She
was his; at last she had surrendered. And Ashe
was in the hollow of his hand. Zaanan Frame, too,
was beaten.</p>

<p>From first to last the thing had been handled efficiently,
as an able business man should handle it.
He leaned back and lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>For a few moments he puffed contentedly. Marie
did not return. Presently he grew impatient. Another
few minutes, and he leaped up to tramp the
length of the porch.</p>

<p>Still she did not come. He stepped to the door
and called:</p>

<p>“Marie! Marie! What’s keeping you all this
time?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. He called again, went inside.
Marie was not down-stairs. He called Mrs.
Stickney. The widow answered from above.</p>

<p>“Is Marie up there?” Moran called.</p>

<p>“Hain’t seen her,” said the widow.</p>

<p>“Didn’t she just come up there?”</p>

<p>“Not unless she’s quieter’n a spook. Nobody’s
passed my door.”</p>

<p>“Where is she, then?” He was in a rage now.
“Where’s she gone to?”</p>

<p>“I hain’t no idee,” said the widow, sharply, “but
if she’s where you don’t know where she is I calc’late
I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>Her door slammed. Moran stood an instant.
The suspicion that had been germinating within
him became certainty. The girl had played him
like a fish. She was gone to warn Ashe.</p>

<p>He pulled his hat on furiously and ran—ran toward
the hotel to intercept Marie.</p>

<h1 id='t8304'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1>

<p>Marie stopped, panting, at the hotel piazza.
“Mr. Ashe?” she said. “Where’s Mr. Ashe?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t been gone more ’n couple of minutes.
Feller, all excited up, stopped and says somethin’
to him, and off he goes like somebody was robbin’ his
hen-house.”</p>

<p>She was too late! He was gone! Where? Marie
guessed. Somebody else had warned him, and he
was off for Crab Creek Trestle.</p>

<p>“Who was with him? Did he go alone?”</p>

<p>“Just up and rushed off like sixty. Didn’t wait
for nothin’ or nobody.”</p>

<p>It was like him. Sudden Jim! He had not
paused for help, but had plunged ahead alone. How
futile it was! What could he do alone save rush into
danger? Marie felt there was danger. A business
matter Moran had called it, yet in the heart of the
woods that might happen which could not be considered
a business transaction. Jim might come
upon Moran’s agents as they set their fire. What
then? Would they pause to consider if here were
business? Would Jim pause to think of business?
No. There would be violence—and Jim alone.</p>

<p>There is a cave-dweller hidden in each of us. At
some hour it will emerge, our varnish of civilization
will peel from us, and we shall stand forth primitive,
thinking, functioning as did the remote ancestors
of the race. This was Marie’s hour. Her man was
rushing into danger—and she was not with him.</p>

<p>She did not consider if her presence would help;
if she could do better service otherwise. Her instinct
was to be with him, to share what came to
him. She would warn him, delay him, if possible.
But that was not the chief thing. The foremost
thought was to stand at his side, to feel his presence.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the stares of astonishment that
followed her, the buzz of comment and surmise that
remained behind, she followed the path Jim had
taken, heading toward the railroad. But she did
not follow the rails as Jim had done. She crossed
the track and plunged into a marshy country, treacherous
underfoot, grown thickly with undergrowth
that tore at her garments, scratched her face. She
was cutting across a curve in the railroad, hoping so
to overtake Jim.</p>

<p>Now she floundered and fell, was up again to
struggle forward. Her feet sank in marsh ooze;
sometimes she waded stagnant water that gurgled
above her shoe-tops. But she stopped for nothing.
Another might have become confused in the blackness
of the night, for the moon was hidden by
clouds which promised storm, but Marie had traversed
those woods again and again. She was the
daughter of a lumberjack, and woodcraft was bred
into the very fiber of her.</p>

<p>Once her ankle turned under her with a sickening
pain; but she forced herself to rise and limp onward.
“Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!” she whispered to herself
over and over again, unconscious that she was
whispering. Her body was not inured to such endeavors,
but her will was master of her body. When
exhaustion would have brought her to the ground
her will held her upright, gave her strength to
flounder onward, always to the accompaniment of
that hysterical whisper: “Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>Her skirts, soggy with the slime of marsh pools,
clung to her legs; her hair hung about her face,
caught on projecting branches, to be torn loose ruthlessly.
She seemed not to feel the pain of it. The
flesh of her hands was lacerated; blood oozed from
more than one abrasion upon her cheeks. She was
unconscious of it. All of consciousness that remained
was the knowledge that Jim Ashe was there
ahead of her somewhere, going to his death, perhaps;
that she could, must warn him, save him So she
floundered on, with the whispered words “Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!” urging her ahead. Perhaps she
heard the words; perhaps they helped to spur her
on. There came a moment when she did hear
them, but fancied they were spoken by another.
“Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>It seemed as if she had been traveling so always,
forcing her way through nightmare obstructions,
encountering such vain labors as are only to be met
with in vivid, horrible dreams. Then she tripped,
fell, striking her shoulder against something hard,
cold. She felt it with her hand, and cried aloud.
It was the railroad! She had won to the railroad!</p>

<p>Was Jim ahead or behind? There was no time to
study. Her mind was in no condition to reason;
there was only the feverish urge that forced her on.
“Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!” She turned up the
track, now trying pitifully to run, now wavering,
staggering, but always persevering.</p>

<p>How black it was! She strained her eyes forward.
He might be near, very near, yet she could not see
him, and any moment her strength might fail.</p>

<p>She demanded yet another effort from the forces
so near exhaustion. “Jim!” she cried, shrilly,
wildly. “Jim! Jim! Wait, oh, wait!”</p>

<p>A hundred yards up the track Jim heard the cry,
stopped, listened.</p>

<p>“Jim, wait!” It sounded more faintly. A woman’s
voice, here, calling his name! There was but
one woman in Diversity who had ever called him Jim.</p>

<p>In this moment, a moment he knew was weighted
with danger to him, came her voice out of the black
mystery that lay behind him. It was startling,
unbelievable. He asked himself if much worry,
much travail of heart, had not deranged some spring
or cog in his imagination, so that he heard things
which were not. If it really were Marie, what was
she doing there? She had betrayed him once; was
this another act in tune with her betrayal? He
braced himself against a fresh danger, an unforeseen
danger, and waited.</p>

<p>She tottered up to him out of the black blanket of
night; tottered, hands fumbling before her, his
name on her lips, his name and that other word
which her will had set there so that it was repeated
endlessly without volition: “Jim, hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!”</p>

<p>Her fingers touched him before she was aware of
his presence; touched him, clung to him. She cried
aloud, inarticulately. Panting, sobbing, she tried
to speak, but only repeated over and over that one
word: “Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>He felt her fingers slipping from him, felt her body
sagging, falling. His arm passed round her, sustaining
her. Her head sank in the hollow of her arm
and she sighed with weary contentment.</p>

<p>“Marie, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Hurry!” she muttered.</p>

<p>But he shook her, not roughly, but with boyish
impatience, boyish alarm.</p>

<p>“No, no! Why are you here? What is the matter?”</p>

<p>Her mind cleared slowly; her will that had set on
one determination, to reach him—set so it could not
loose its hold—relaxed. She breathed deeply, pushed
against him in an effort to stand free.</p>

<p>“Crab Creek Trestle,” she said. “He’s—going to
burn it. He warned you—to get you—out here.”</p>

<p>His suspicion reared itself between them.</p>

<p>“How do you know? What are you doing here?
Did he send you?”</p>

<p>She quivered, sobbed dryly—then she shoved him
away.</p>

<p>“I know because he boasted of it. That—and
other things. To-morrow that—note. The bank
will make you pay it. He—said he—would be
making clothespins—in your mill—”</p>

<p>“But you—why are you here? What do you
want?”</p>

<p>She summoned her strength and her pride.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t—matter why—I am here. You must
go back. You mustn’t go on.”</p>

<p>“So that’s it,” he said, bitterly. “He sent you
to hold me back till they could do the work.”</p>

<p>He turned and began to stride away.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried. “You mustn’t go!”</p>

<p>“Go back to town, Marie,” he said, his voice
quivering, not with wrath, but with pain. “Go
back. I’m going on.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t!” She took one tottering step toward
him and sank until she was on her knees. He
would not believe her. He would not be warned.</p>

<p>What she had suffered, the things she had just
done, had been in vain.</p>

<p>“Go back,” he said, dully. “It isn’t safe out
there. Go back.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t safe for you—for <span class='it'>you</span>. It’s planned to
have you come—alone.”</p>

<p>He moved away from her. She forced herself to
rise.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go with you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Go back!” he commanded.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, and tottered on.</p>

<p>He set his teeth, turned his face away from her,
and went on, unmindful of her sobbing, gasping
breaths. At one moment they saw a redness in the
sky; saw the darkness ahead fluttering like a waved
cloth.</p>

<p>“Fire,” Jim muttered, and began to run. He was
too late—Crab Creek Trestle was in names!</p>

<p>As best she could Marie followed. He gained,
but she did not falter, urged herself to her utmost.
Ahead of them the trestle came into view, wreathed
in flames, flames that leaped and writhed and
strained upward as if seeking to be released from
bonds that held them to earth. The trees and
bushes about seemed to rise and fall with the swelling
of the tongues of fire. In the midst the framework
of the trestle stood black, stark, startlingly vivid.</p>

<p>For a moment Jim stood where bank and trestle
met, stood undecided. There was nothing to do, yet
he must do something, for it was his nature to do
something. Nothing would save the trestle. He
perceived that, though he hesitated to admit it.
He saw that the work of incendiarism had been done
efficiently; timbers had been well soaked with oil,
and the match applied not in one spot but in scores
of places. Except for a matter of thirty feet at the
end where Jim stood the whole structure was flame-wrapped.
From the very brook fire seemed to flow
upward; here and there, twenty feet below, marsh
grass burst into ruddy, living flower.</p>

<p>Without plan or reason Jim started forward upon
the trestle, as if to plunge headlong into the dancing,
undulating, seething mass of destruction and stifle
it with his hands.</p>

<p>Marie, now at his side, clutched his arm to restrain
him. He shook her off ungently, sprang forward.
She kept at his side. Again he was forced to pause,
shading his face from the heat that reached out to
meet him. His eyes were for nothing but the fire;
saw nothing aside from it.</p>

<p>Waves of heat surged against him, forced him to
draw back, and the very action of retreating cleared
his head, restored him to something resembling
calm. Instinct, impulse withdrew, leaving intellect
in command. He thought of his father. What he
saw before him was his father’s—Clothespin Jimmy’s—life-work
disappearing in flames. He had been
given his father’s shoes. How had he filled them?
The destruction of this trestle was the destruction of
the Ashe Clothespin Company. He should have
foreseen this danger, guarded against it adequately.
In that he had failed.</p>

<p>Again Marie was at his side. “Come back,” she
said. “You can do no good.”</p>

<p>He did not notice her, but stepped forward again,
forcing himself against the heat. She clung to him.</p>

<p>“You can’t put it out,” she said again. “Come
back out of danger.”</p>

<p>He turned on her, eyes flashing, jaw set.</p>

<p>“Put it out!” he said, harshly. “I’m not thinking
about putting it out. It’s gone!” He was Sudden
Jim now, not defeated, still fighting.</p>

<p>“Go back and tell Moran you left me figuring how
to get logs from there to here. And tell him I’m
going to do it. Tell him if he’d burned the woods
I’d find some way to make logs out of the ashes.”</p>

<p>Presently he spoke again—to himself.</p>

<p>“I wish Nelson was here,” he said. He was
trying to figure construction, needed his millwright’s
advice.</p>

<p>In that moment Clothespin Jimmy might have felt
satisfaction in his son, for young Jim had forgotten
the blow just dealt him, had forgotten the fire that
raged at his feet. His thoughts dealt only with the
future. He wasted no moment in discouragement,
though he might well have been discouraged. One
thought he held: Logs must cross the gap before
him. But how? His fingers doubled into determined
fists.</p>

<p>“It can be done,” he said, “and I’ll find the way!”</p>

<p>An older woodsman than Jim, a man experienced
in the handling of logs, would have shaken his head.
Such a man would have seen the difficulties of the
task; would have declared it impossible to haul
timber across that swamp before winter.</p>

<p>Jim’s inexperience refused to be daunted.</p>

<p>His head was clear now; he was himself. Marie—she
had been there. He turned upon her.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he demanded, fiercely,
but she was not upright before him. She lay upon
the cross-ties, one arm dangling limply through, the
garish light exaggerating the pallor of her face.</p>

<p>“Marie!” he whispered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She did not stir or answer. Her endurance had
been urged to the point of breakage, had given way.
He was on his knees beside her, his heart gripped by
fear, for he had never seen a woman faint. He lifted
her. Her head lopped grotesquely to one side as he
moved her, and this multiplied his fright. He had
loved her, and she was dead. She had not been
worth a man’s love; had been treacherous; had
betrayed him; but he had given her all of his love.
Her breast lifted laboriously. He was conscious of a
feeling of relief, not of gladness. So this would not
be the end of things between them. They would
continue to inhabit the same world. To him it
seemed the world was oversmall to house them both.</p>

<p>Whatever she had done, he could not leave her so.
He strained until she lay partly across his shoulder—a
weight it would have been joy for him to bear
a few short hours before—and so, staggering under
his burden, he strove toward Diversity.</p>

<p>Long miles lay between him and town; no help
was nearer; no shelter for Marie. He found himself
near the point of exhaustion. But he labored on.</p>

<p>After a length of time that seemed to have
stretched into hours Jim was aware of the dark
figure of a man standing between the tracks before
him.</p>

<p>Somehow Jim was not interested in it, was not
interested in anything save the effort to keep on his
feet and make progress. The man spoke with a
voice Jim knew but did not identify.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Jim asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Gilders,” said the man. “Here, I’ll take her.
You carry my rifle. You’ve lugged her about as far
as you can, hain’t you?”</p>

<p>“All of that,” Jim said, surrendering his burden
and sitting down abruptly.</p>

<p>“Rest a bit,” said Gilders. “When you’re ready,
say so. We’ll take her to my place—it’s nearer ’n
Diversity.”</p>

<p>Presently Jim got to his feet.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>Gilders raised Marie without effort and strode
away with her in his arms. Jim followed. At times
Gilders waited to permit Jim to rest, for Jim could
not equal the woodsman’s pace, indeed could not
have sustained any pace at all without frequent stops.</p>

<p>That last tramp was a thing of vagueness to Jim.
How long it was, how many minutes, hours, days it
required to traverse the distance, he did not know.
It was a hades of blackness and weariness and pain.
At last they arrived at Gilders’s shanty. Steve laid
Marie on his bed. Jim waited for no bed, but sank
to the floor, and the night held no further consciousness
for him.</p>

<p>Somehow Steve procured a neighbor woman who
gave of her kindliness and skill to Marie, ministering,
watching through the night. Steve let Jim lie as he
had fallen. Sleep, he knew, would work its own reviving
miracle.</p>

<h1 id='t8717'>CHAPTER XXIV</h1>

<p>On caucus days or election days it had been
Zaanan Frame’s custom to sit in his office and
receive his friends. There were few who did not
take that opportunity to shake Zaanan’s hand, to
show themselves at his levee. Most came because
it was their pleasure to do so; some came because
they regarded it as the part of wisdom.</p>

<p>But on this caucus day Zaanan sat alone. Outside
on the steps was Dolf Springer, taciturn, doleful.
That was all. The old man was deserted. Diversity
had forsaken him on the day of his downfall. The
power he had wielded for more than a generation
had dropped from him, leaving in the place of the
political dictator merely a tired, weary, disappointed
old man.</p>

<p>He had taken some comfort in that greatest of all
books, the <span class='it'>Justices’ Guide</span>. Now he laid it aside and
rose.</p>

<p>“Dolf,” he called.</p>

<p>The one faithful retainer entered.</p>

<p>“Calc’late we’ll be startin’ for the op’ry-house,
Dolf.”</p>

<p>On other years this had been a sort of triumphal
procession. Zaanan had marched to the opera-house
surrounded by his friends. Now he looked quizzically
at Dolf.</p>

<p>“Seems like we was sort of scarce this mornin’,
Dolf, eh?”</p>

<p>“Doggone ’em!” said Dolf, vindictively.</p>

<p>They started, a pitiful procession. As they made
their progress there were eyes that turned away with
a feeling of shame; other eyes stared gleefully. Here
was ocular evidence that Zaanan Frame was beaten;
that they, the sovereign voters of Diversity, had been
able thus easily to reach out and pluck him down.</p>

<p>When Zaanan arrived the opera-house was full.
Zaanan, who had for years been given a conspicuous
place of honor, found a seat with difficulty. He
sank listlessly into his chair, slid forward with
extended legs, and let the brush of his beard rest on
the bosom of his shirt. He did not look about him.</p>

<p>Had he studied the hall, he must have been surprised,
not alone at the numbers present, but at the
composition of the spectators. In Diversity women
were accustomed to take no part in politics—even
that slight part of watching their men functioning
in caucus or convention. But this morning was presented
a condition abnormal. The gallery, usually
occupied by a sprinkling of loafers, was filled with
women. Not ten women or a score of women, but
row after row of women; the mothers and wives of
Diversity in a body.</p>

<p>Others had been surprised by it. Not a few
husbands had remarked upon it to wives as they left
their housework and departed. Some wives had
evaded questions; the bolder ones and the majority
did not hesitate to inform their husbands, in words
easily understood, that their reasons for going to the
caucus were nobody’s business but their own.</p>

<p>The monotonous routine of organization was completed.
Throughout, Peleg Goodwin had been in the
public eye. He was a figure of importance. He
already assumed the dignity of the office which was
to be his as it had once been Zaanan’s. Peleg had
views as to his future. What Zaanan had done Peleg
could do. True, Moran was putting him where he
was; but later—Peleg would see to that. His bearing
was feudal.</p>

<p>The gallery had watched impatiently, if silently.
So this was polities? So these futilely buzzing,
smoking, lounging male creatures below were actually
their husbands exercising a high rite of
citizenship! It was monotonous. It even moved
some of them to giggles. Many of them had invested
the caucus with the dignity of mystery, with
a certain pomp and regality. Now they saw it as it
was, in no wise different from a casual gathering round
the wood-stove in the post-office on any day in winter.</p>

<p>“So that’s how it’s done,” said the Widow Stickney.
“Huh! ’Tain’t much more glitterin’ than
peelin’ potaters. And I doubt if it’s as useful.”</p>

<p>But when the moment arrived for nominations for
the office of justice of the peace, the women leaned
forward, interested, not to miss a phase of it.</p>

<p>Young Lawyer Bourne placed Peleg in nomination,
did so noisily, flamboyantly, with waving of arms
and screaming of eagle. He mentioned Peleg as
Peleg had never been mentioned before. If the
young man had not mentioned Peleg’s name at the
outset, that worthy candidate would not himself
have recognized the subject of the speech. But
Peleg enjoyed it. Maybe that’s what he really was
and hadn’t realized it; maybe that’s what his fellow-men
had been thinking about him for years, wasted
years. Why, with such regard he might have risen
to the Governor’s chair!</p>

<p>“Look at Peleg,” whispered the widow. “If
somebody don’t tie a strap round his chist he’s
a-goin’ to bust.”</p>

<p>Peleg’s nomination was duly seconded, not by
Michael Moran, for Moran’s residence was elsewhere,
but to Moran’s satisfaction. He sat on the
aisle, well toward the front, and had been the recipient
of much attention. Easily Moran was the
dominant figure of the body. Why should he not
be, on this his day of victory over his enemies?</p>

<p>Zaanan sat motionless, spoke to no one, paid no
attention to what went forward. He was there, that
was all. It seemed as if he had come from, habit,
not from interest. After the first few moments he
was forgotten, unnoticed. Zaanan had been moved
on to oblivion.</p>

<p>Bob Allen nominated Zaanan. He made no
speech, simply mounted the platform and announced
that he placed the name of Zaanan Frame before
the caucus as a candidate for the justiceship. It was
a form, that was all. Then he stepped down.</p>

<p>“Any secondin’ speech?” asked the chairman—a
form, too.</p>

<p>“Calc’late there is,” said a voice at the rear of the
hall, and Steve Gilders arose, for once detached from
the rifle which had grown to be as much a part of
him as his arms.</p>

<p>As Steve walked forward, indeed, as the first of his
words fell on the ears of the body, it became silent.
Men looked at one another, felt a tenseness in the air,
an apprehension. A small boy walked by Steve’s
side, his hand in Steve’s.</p>

<p>Together they mounted the platform, stood facing
the hall.</p>

<p>“I’m here to second that there nomination,” Steve
said, harshly. “Bein’s I haint taught in speech-makin’
I fetched help. But I figger the boy and
me’ll be able to make out.”</p>

<p>He got down on one knee so his face was on a level
with the child’s.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Steve,” said the little one.</p>

<p>“What’s your other name?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got none.”</p>

<p>Every man, every woman, in the house was
straining forward. Here was something not to be
expected by any; something fraught with meaning.
Michael Moran was of those whose eyes were
fixed on the two figures. He half arose to his feet,
then sank back, face distorted, fists clenched.</p>

<p>“Who was your ma?” Steve asked, in a voice that
chilled.</p>

<p>“Susie Gilders.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“She’s dead.”</p>

<p>“What killed her?”</p>

<p>“She did,” said the child, his lips quivering.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“On account of me.”</p>

<p>The gallery became audible—it gasped once, then
was silent again.</p>

<p>“Who is your pa?” Steve went on, inexorably.</p>

<p>“Michael Moran.”</p>

<p>“Who do you hate?”</p>

<p>“Michael Moran.”</p>

<p>Steve arose, lifted the child above his head.</p>

<p>“Look at him, folks,” he said; “he’s secondin’ the
nomination of Zaanan Frame.”</p>

<p>He turned, now leading the boy, descended from
the platform, passed down the aisle toward the rear
of the hall. The child’s coat brushed Moran’s sleeve,
unconscious of whom it passed. Moran shrank
away from the touch.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke, nobody moved, save Moran. He
leaped to his feet, face working with rage, with
shame, with the ignominy of it.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth!” Steve Gilders said over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>In the gallery a woman stood. She pointed downward
to an individual on the floor.</p>

<p>“Tom Samson,” she said, shrilly, “you’re goin’
to vote now. Vote right or don’t come home to me.”</p>

<p>Another woman dared equally. “You, too,
George Perkins.”</p>

<p>Woman after woman was on her feet, singling out
her man, letting him hear her voice in this matter.</p>

<p>The vote was taken in silence, counted in silence.
The hall awaited its announcement in silence. Three
votes were cast for Peleg Goodwin, the rest for
Zaanan Frame.</p>

<p>There was a cheer, but it came not from the floor,
not from the men folk. It was shriller than a cheer
by the men would have been, for it came from the
throats of the wives and mothers of them. Women
not accustomed to politics had taken a hand in that
game. Women not granted the suffrage by our laws
had by their mere presence wielded the powers of the
suffrage. They had not voted in person for Zaanan
Frame; they had exerted no prior influence; but
they had at the moment of action shown their men
what was in their hearts, and the men voted in accord
with it. The women of Diversity had shown
there was a force, a power resident within them, that
was capable of ruling when it sought to rule. Men
versed in the law tell us that in every state the supreme
power must lie definitely in some individual
or some group of individuals. Where autocracy,
absolutism, obtains, the supreme fountainhead of
authority is in the autocrat; in a republic it abides
in the citizens. The women of Diversity had made
apparent where resided the ultimate authority in
their village.</p>

<p>Moran had left the opera-house.</p>

<p>Scatteringly at first, then with volume, arose
shouts for Zaanan. Shamefaced men bellowed his
name, at first because they were ashamed, afraid,
to do otherwise, then with an infection of enthusiasm,
perhaps with a clearness of vision they had been deprived
of hitherto. Zaanan walked forward slowly,
gravely, with no indication of elation in his face.
From the platform he eyed them sternly.</p>

<p>“Folks,” he began, presently, “I can’t say I take
any pride in this. I don’t feel like I’d been honored.
No, I hain’t been honored, except by them that
hadn’t votes to vote. My heart hain’t so old but it
kin appreciate bein’ trusted and respected by them
that sits in the gallery. They stayed by me when
you forsook me. You men, ’tain’t on your accounts
I’m takin’ this place agin; it’s because of them
women that I’ve seen babies in their cradles, and for
the babies that is in their cradles to-day.”</p>

<p>He stopped to remove his spectacles.</p>

<p>“I should ’a’ let you have a dose of Peleg and
Moran. It would ’a’ been good for you. But I seen
you didn’t have sense nor judgment to know what
you was doin’, so I done what I’ve had to do before.
I took things into my own hands, and for another
spell things’ll go on as they did before. I was hopin’
you’d learned. I was hopin’, when I come to step
out for good, that you’d be fit to handle the job
yourselves. I’m disapp’inted in that, so I’ll hang
on as long as I can.”</p>

<p>He stopped again and tugged at his beard, and
glowered at the men as one might glower at refractory
children.</p>

<p>“Some of you men that’s here to-day has money
in your pockets that don’t b’long there. It’s Michael
Moran’s money. For a dollar or two, that’ll be
spent and forgot in a week, you sold somethin’ that’s
next worse to sell than the decency of your homes.
You sold somethin’ that men have fought for and
give their all for. The whole of this here nation’s
built up on you and others like you. You’re a part
of the Gov’ment; the nation trusts each feller to do
his votin’ and his politics to the best of his judgment.
But you hain’t done that. You’ve up and sold your
votes. I calc’late I hain’t never been more ashamed.
At the door of this op’ry-house is Dolf Springer
holdin’ a bushel basket. He’s holdin’ it in plain
sight of all. If you that’s took money hopes to
have my respect, and the respect of your wives and
mothers and daughters, you’ll rise now and march
past Dolf, and you’ll chuck into that basket the
Judas-money that’s soilin’ your pockets. Now, I’m
waitin’.”</p>

<p>They looked at one another shamefaced, each man
afraid to be the first to rise.</p>

<p>“Tom Samson,” came his wife’s voice, “you head
that percession.”</p>

<p>There was the hint of a nervous laugh from the
men, but Tom got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Zaanan,” he said, shakily, “I’m a dum sight
more ashamed ’n you be of me,” and he marched
to make his deposit in Dolf’s basket.</p>

<p>It was a procession. Men formed in line behind
Tom, and there were leathery faces that felt for the
first time in many years the down-trickle of tears.
Zaanan was wiping his eyes unashamed. Audible
sobs descended from the gallery. The atmosphere
was that of a revival—it was a revival, a moment
of regeneration, a moment that would linger in the
minds of those men as long as mind and body remained
bound together. The line filed past Dolf
and the men returned to their seats.</p>

<p>“I calc’late the business of this caucus is about
over,” Zaanan said. “When what’s left to be done
is over I wisht Parson Bloom ’u’d say a benediction.
’Tain’t usual at sich meetin’s, but ’twon’t do any
harm.”</p>

<p>So it was done. Aged Parson Bloom mounted the
platform, his silvery head bared, and held his arms
extended over them. His words were few, simple:</p>

<p>“‘The Lord watch between me and thee, when we
are absent one from another.’”</p>

<p>Then they passed out, leaving Zaanan alone on the
platform, seated in a huge arm-chair, his head bent
wearily, his face in his hands.</p>

<h1 id='t9087'>CHAPTER XXV</h1>

<p>Jim, in what might be termed a ramshackle
physical condition, drove to town the morning
of the caucus. His left arm occupied a sling. He
had not seen Marie. She would not have known
him had he seen her, for she lay in the borderland,
not delirious, not unconscious wholly, but strangely
indifferent, still. He did not wish to see her.</p>

<p>He went directly to his office, nor did he leave it
during the morning. The caucus was in progress.
He had been vitally interested in it. But this morning
nothing interested him; he was apathetic. Part
of this was due to physical condition, more to mental
stress.</p>

<p>Even when the Diversity Bank presented for payment
his note for thirty thousand dollars he was not
aroused. It would have been his nature to do something,
anything, in an effort to avert calamity;
but it was not Sudden Jim who sat before his desk.
It was just Jim, shorn of the attribute which had
earned him his name.</p>

<p>He had expected the note to be presented. Well,
he could not pay. There was no way to pay. Somehow
he had failed, and his father would think the
family blood had grown thin in his veins. Even that
mattered little. Moran had beaten him. The burning
of Crab Creek Trestle was a decisive blow. Before
it could be replaced the logs in his yard would
be exhausted, the mills must shut down for lack of
raw material. There was no use to try to sweep
back the inevitable; it was attempting to stay the
inflowing tide with a broom.</p>

<p>He did not leave the office at dinner-time, but
asked young Newell to fetch him a lunch from the
hotel. Three days remained, the days of grace allowed
by law after the presentation of his note.
He saw no use for them.</p>

<p>It had not yet struck one o’clock when Zaanan
Frame came in.</p>

<p>“Feelin’ perty bad, Jim, eh? Had a perty tough
time?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“Git on your hat. I’ve fetched Tiffany, and we’ll
drive down to the Diversity Company’s annual
meetin’. Guess a drive after the best hoss in the
county’ll perk you up consid’able.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use, Judge? They’ve got me. I’m
done.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Sudden Jim, eh? Don’t act very sudden
jest now. What’s ailin’ your ambition?”</p>

<p>Jim told him briefly, with complete discouragement.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t at the caucus this mornin’?” Zaanan
asked.</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t have the heart to go.”</p>

<p>“Figgered I was beat, didn’t you, eh? Figgered
the ol’ man didn’t have a ghost of a show?”</p>

<p>“I knew it.”</p>

<p>“Um! No more show ’n you’ve got to pull out
of this mess? Not any more show than that, eh?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re in the same boat.”</p>

<p>“You hain’t asked who got nominated this
mornin’, Jim.”</p>

<p>“No need to, Zaanan.”</p>

<p>Zaanan chuckled. “Wa-al, you’re a-goin’ to hear
news then. Peleg he slipped up some on his calc’lations.”</p>

<p>Interest gleamed in Jim’s eyes at last.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he said.</p>

<p>“Folks sort of, after a manner, made up their
minds they couldn’t git along without me.”</p>

<p>“You beat them?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. And I hadn’t no more chance ’n
you’ve got. I was as beat as you be, if not beater,
wasn’t I? Which p’ints out the fact you never can
tell who’s licked till the constable stops the fight—and
sometimes not then. Goin’ to git on your hat,
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Judge Frame,” said Jim, “you’re a great man! if
you say to keep up the struggle, why”—he put on his
hat and stood up—“why, let’s get to that meeting.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t no time to lose. Got to git there swift,
so I fetched Tiffany. You’re goin’ to ride behind a
hoss now, young feller.”</p>

<p>Jim did not smile.</p>

<p>Zaanan was not joking, but speaking with firm
faith in his ancient steed. What Tiffany had been
in his youth Tiffany still was to the old judge. The
horse had not changed in his eyes. They had grown
old together, but Zaanan’s love for the creature, his
admiration for qualities long vanished, were steadfast
as ever.</p>

<p>“Lemme tell you some facts,” said Zaanan.
“There’s times when facts is better ammunition ’n
bullets. Moran’s consid’able spraddled out financially.
He’s made every dollar that belongs to him
git to work and do more ’n any dollar ought to do.
He’s a reacher. Been a-reachin’ out and a-reachin’
out till it looks like his arm must ’a’ got stretched.
Owns stock in the railroad—not a majority, but
consid’able. Gits control by proxies. Then along
come this Diversity Hardwood Company, and he
must git his hands on to it. He’s got some money,
but ’tain’t enough. So he puts up his railroad stock
for collateral and buys a block of Diversity Company.
Then he talks the stockholders into thinkin’ he’s
consid’able big punkin. Two fellers in Grand Rapids
that owns control up and makes him president and
general manager of the outfit—and takes over his
notes and collateral for him. They’re a-carryin’
him, ’cause they figgered he was a man could make
money for ’em. Got that all down, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Know what to do with it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then p’int your ears and listen.”</p>

<p>While Tiffany jogged along at the breakneck pace
Zaanan attributed to him the old justice instructed
Jim.</p>

<p>Eleven stockholders in the Diversity Hardwood
Company were present at the meeting, including
Zaanan and Jim. Moran was in the chair. He had
raised objection when Jim entered, but was referred
to the company’s stock-book. The meeting was
called to order and routine business completed.
The election of directors was imminent.</p>

<p>Jim stood up.</p>

<p>“Mister Chairman,” he said, “before we start on
this election there is a matter I want to lay before the
stockholders.”</p>

<p>“We have more important business than to listen
to you now,” snapped Moran.</p>

<p>“The most important business this meeting can
attend to is what I have to lay before them.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, go ahead,” said a burly, grizzly-haired
man who lounged back in his chair smoking a huge
and powerful cigar. “What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>“As a stockholder in this company I charge the
president with more than one act prejudicial to the
interest of the company and with more than one
act reflecting on the honor and business integrity of
the concern.”</p>

<p>Moran leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“This is the man who hired a gang of toughs to
raid our camps and steal our railroad. He’s stolen
our timber; he’s on the verge of bankruptcy—owing
us money—and last night he went on to our property
and set fire to Crab Creek Trestle. He’ll see the
inside of jail for that.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Moran, one at a time,” said the big
man. “You’ll get your chance. Go ahead, young
fellow. You’ve made your statements; now back
them up—or git.”</p>

<p>“First,” said Jim, “this company needs the Le
Bar tract. Is that not so?”</p>

<p>“You bet we do,” said the big man.</p>

<p>“Moran has had a chance to buy—at a reasonable
figure—and has refused even to deal. I have an
option on that timber. Because I have it, because
he is after my scalp, he won’t deal. You’ve tried to
buy of Le Bar for half a dozen years. That’s charge
number one.”</p>

<p>“His price was exorbitant. It was a hold-up,”
Moran shouted.</p>

<p>“You have never asked a price. I have never
put a price on the land—to you or to anybody else.
Next, he has done all in his power to cripple the
Ashe Clothespin Company, which is your most
valuable single asset. He’s been bought up by the
Clothespin Club. First he hired a man to cripple
our machinery; another of his men filled our logs
with spikes for us to saw into. His railroad has
withheld cars for our shipments. These acts
he has done as president of this concern. Is it
pleasant to you gentlemen that your president, in
your own woods, should spike your own logs and ship
them to a valuable customer? These things I am
in position to prove. He refused to carry out the
terms of this company’s contract, would not give us
logs, so I had to avail myself of the permission of the
contract to seize and operate your logging machinery.
And, finally, last night, by his orders, property of
this company was destroyed by fire. Michael Moran
burned Crab Creek Trestle. This I can prove.”</p>

<p>“It’s an infernal lie!” Moran shouted.</p>

<p>“There, there,” said the big man. “If Mr. Ashe
is lying we’ll see you have satisfaction. Just prove
the burning of the trestle; well let the other matters
go for another day.”</p>

<p>Zaanan went to the door and called. Steve Gilders
came in, rifle under his arm, pushing another individual
before him.</p>

<p>“Here’s your proof,” said Zaanan, dryly. “Go
ahead, Steve.”</p>

<p>“This here feller,” said Steve, “burned the trestle
last night. Soaked her with oil and touched her off.
Then he took a shot at Mr. Ashe there—and thought
he’d got him. Calc’late he thought so till this
minnit, for he hain’t heard nothin’ to the contrary.
Now, Kowterski, I seen you. Who told you to burn
that there trestle?”</p>

<p>“He did,” said Kowterski, pointing to Moran.</p>

<p>Moran sprang toward Kowterski, but Gilders
shifted his rifle. “Don’t go prancin’ round. I guess
you know I wouldn’t grieve none if I was forced to
hurt you, Moran.”</p>

<p>“Moran,” said the big man, “this isn’t altogether
unexpected. My good friend, Judge Frame, has
been in touch with me, and we’ve done a bit of investigating
ourselves. Now I’ll tell you what we’re
going to do, Wilkins and I. We’ve held you up;
you had us on the blind side. Personally I don’t
like to be fooled. It r’iles me, and I’m good and
plenty r’iled. We sha’n’t press the incendiarism
charge. Putting you in prison wouldn’t make me
any happier; but busting you would. This locality
won’t be broken-hearted to see you removed from it.
Your notes are due; we shall not renew. Our
attorneys have been notified to take the usual steps
to realize on your collateral. Now if I were you
I’d clear out. We haven’t any more use for you
here.”</p>

<p>Moran protested, threatened, raved. When he
was done and the room was rid of him, the big man
turned to Jim:</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve earned a name, young man.
Sudden Jim, is it? A good name, and your father’ll
be glad to hear of it. Maybe I can give you a piece
of news. Saw Welliver and Jenkins yesterday.
They’re through. The Clothespin Club will be good
if you’ll cry quits. Meeting next week in Grand
Rapids, and you’d better go.”</p>

<p>“About that option of yours, son,” said the stockholder
named Wilkins, “we know what it cost you.
You’re entitled to your profit. Will two dollars an
acre satisfy you? If it will the board, when it is
elected, will instruct the treasurer to give you his
check for the amount.”</p>

<p>The movement of affairs had been too swift even
for Sudden Jim. The revolution in his condition
had been too rapid. He could scarcely grasp it.
Moran done for, himself offered a profit on his
option which would pay the note presented that day
and leave a pleasant margin of cash! His acceptance
was prompt.</p>

<p>He drove back to Diversity with Zaanan after the
meeting. For most of the way he was silent, dazed
at the outcome of affairs. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>“Judge,” said he, “I said you were a great man
this afternoon—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Jim.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for you—”</p>

<p>“To be sure! To be sure! It’s my business to
meddle. And, besides, Clothespin Jimmy and I was
raised side by side. He licked me four times ’fore
I was twelve year old. He told me to sorter look
after you a mite, figgerin’ you might need it. And
say, son, if I was you I’d go hell-for-leather out to
Steve’s place. You’ve been messin’ up things with
that girl out there. I dun’no’ but you ought to git
thrashed for actin’ so; but you’re young and sudden.”
Zaanan smiled dryly. “’Twa’n’t Marie told Moran
you was goin’ to swoop down on his camp; it was
that young Newell up to your office. Call to mind,
it was him warned you the trestle was goin’ to burn.
Moran’s had him bought up quite a spell.”</p>

<p>“Judge—” said Jim. “Judge—”</p>

<p>“Yes, son, you’re as big a dum fool as you figger
you are, and maybe more. The young is inclined
to value themselves high.”</p>

<p>“Will you drive me out to her? Now? She’ll
never forget—never forgive—what I said to her and
believed; but I’ve got to tell her. I’ve got to beg
her forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“While you’re doin’ your beggin’,” said Zaanan,
shrewdly, “you might throw in a few words about
how much you think of her. Eh? That kind of
talk is sort of flavorin’ in a girl’s ear.”</p>

<p>“There is a good deal of it for me to say,” said Jim.</p>

<p>He did not speak again until the miles to Steve
Gilders’s shanty were traversed, until they stood at
the low door of the house. Jim rushed ahead of
Zaanan, opened the door.</p>

<p>“Is she—Where is she? Can I—I must see her
now!” he said to the astonished woman who had sat
with Marie through the night.</p>

<p>“She’s perked up a mite,” said the woman, “but
she don’t act like she was happy. Go right in.
She’s able to talk to folks now.”</p>

<p>Jim opened the door and entered the bedroom
softly. He found Marie’s eyes on his face as he
turned toward the bed, dark wells of misery.</p>

<p>“Marie,” he whispered, and knelt by her side, his
hand fumbling for her hand. “Marie, it was cruel.
I—I have no excuse to offer you. Where I should
have trusted I failed to trust. I loved you—but I
was not worthy to love you. Even when I believed
you had done that thing, I loved you. I could not
tear it out of my heart. There is nothing I can do
but tell you how my love failed, and beg you to
forgive me if you can. What is gone is gone. I
have lost you, and I know the bitterness of loss.”</p>

<p>She turned her face toward him; her eyes were
beautiful—softly, tenderly beautiful.</p>

<p>“I—am not lost,” she whispered, “so—so badly
that you can’t find me—if you look.”</p>

<p>“Marie!”</p>

<p>“Jim, last night I learned something about love.
I know what it is. I knew you would learn the
truth. All that—I put aside. While I was trying
to reach you I put it aside. I knew love would
abide, through griefs, through whatever had gone
before, whatever was to come. I loved you—would
always love you. Do you know, Jim, I had made
up my mind to fight for my love? Yes, if others had
not proved I did not do that thing, I should have
proved it to you myself. Because I—wanted you,
Jim. Because I had to have you.”</p>

<p>He clung to her hand, speechless. A ray of glory
had fallen upon him, and he was blinded with it.</p>

<p>“Jim,” she said, “you have never kissed me.
You aren’t acting like—the Sudden Jim I want for
my own.”</p>
